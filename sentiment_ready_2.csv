0,47,2021-01-28 21:30:35,exit the system the ceo of nasdaq pushed to halt trading to give investors a chance to recalibrate their positions now sec is investigating brokers are disallowing buying more calls this is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us we get a well shucks you should have known investing is risky have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee maybe doing uber on the side we may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on gme with us we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone we didnt hurt wall street as a whole just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us the media wants to pin the blame on us it should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now its time to build new exchanges that cant arbitrarily change the rules on us cro has some version of these maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention i dont know exactly what it will look like yet but the broad next steps i see are 1 exit the current financial system 2 build a new one
0,16,2021-01-28 21:17:10,once youre done with gme $ag and $slv the gentlemans short squeeze driven by macro fundamentals you guys are champs gme who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the new york times and when youre done with gme its time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the bear stearns jpm merge its all in fucking bloomberg theres an excellent explanation of their scheme here you think gme squeezed hard look what happened to silver half a year ago in july x200b thats one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver having to cover their shorts and thats just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the comex on their bullshit and taking physically delivery of silver which they dont have now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $slv forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the comex this isnt gme whos fair price is maybe around $5 a share the fair price of silver based on the historical goldsilver ratio is almost surely over $50ounce this short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to its fair market value and then theres $ag because once silver starts moving $ag is going to go to the fucking moon 1 its a leverage play on silver 2 its got its own shorts to be squeezed out at least a 23 short float as of last count tldr once this thing gets going shares and calls of $slv and $ag will rocket edit 
560,215,2021-01-28 20:18:32,my brokerage wants to force close my gme calls my brokerage called me and asked me to close my 115 calls expiring this friday if i wouldnt close them at todays market open theyd do it and theyd do it for all customers with gme options expiring this friday i could open a position expiring next week if i wanted to x200b their reasoning was that i didnt have enough cash to exercise the calls and they dont know if trading of gme will be halted for some time in the next few days therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative x200b now im fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike since i also have a ton of shares but this still sounds fishy to me like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares theyd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze they told me i also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media but those were fine gme realls is a big exception right now x200b positions options only x200b edit after i was being sceptical on the phone and asked if they could just close shit like that he told me it was a very unusual situation with big risk involved i told him that there are apparently enough hedge funds with no risk management either and that we wouldnt be in this situation otherwise but he didnt seem like he wanted to hear that

331,94,2021-01-28 20:12:07,there is an alternative to this system how fucking stupid is it that retail gets no chance to participate in any stage of an ipo ive always thought how incredibly fucked up is it that hundreds of people who have literally nothing to do with the formation or creation of a company are buying a preipo at $10 then selling it to millions of retail at $100 only to watch it crash back to $5 we sit there terrified hoping the big guys throw us a bone for those of us here at wsb the last 5 years this leads to massive disillusionment and its all fun and games because everyone on the inside wins how stupid is it that there is no transparency to the underpinnings of valuation and that there is 0 regulation of shorting a company and fucking its employees beyond 100 float just to control the asset when the dust settles be aware there is a massively growing system that does exists which does not allow this that is called decentralized finance worth learning about the future early edit i dont know for sure but i predict the gme situation ends when the government prints the $ to give to melvin and friends bc this is an inflationary system and thats what happens theyll be upset they didnt just print the $ earlier the defi space is backed by deflationary systems and its worth understanding why thats so profoundly different
235,120,2021-01-28 19:57:53,the real price for gme is infinity but at that price your option is worth nothing lets imagine gme has gone to 50000 the market has gone offerless when you exercise your option instead of stock you get oops please wait while we connect you to our operator and your shitty broker is simply ghosting you and turning off the phone line even your stupid lawyer refuses the case because supereme court has suspended the constitution for gme stock holders but lets do some maths if every person on the sub bought 1 call option strike 100 at price 50k that means the seller is liable for 49900x100x2000000 10trillion this will destroy not only the dirty dealing worthless billionaires and the shitty market making crooks it will destroy the entire economy and not a single one of you will get paid because no one has 10 trillion to pay you and even if they had they wouldnt the fed is not going to print 10 t so you can make your gains no way the us financial market is a hollow crooked ponzi and has been for years and there is no way they can stand or accept this hit the real price for gme is infinity but at that price unfortunately your call option is worth nothing it will be reneged
212,57,2021-01-28 19:40:41,the wallstreetbets war museum i purpose that we make a museum to capture the media that has been produced as part of the war if you walk into a ww2 museum you see those dope ass muskets and shit well our lotr and avenger dubs are those and i think its a shame to lose those in the walls of text being posted to hype gme i believe we should take the following action 1 create a pinned post and only allow people to post their high quality meme content created around the gme war 2 when the squeeze is squozen we can seek donations in the form of our new national currency gme stock to purchase a physical location with tvs to display these memes like fuck come on everyone ive seen legit adaptations of songs from les mis out there and i know thats some high tier culture for you retards vote to send a message that we dont want our muskets to be lost to the sands of history or some shit i dunno how it works

308,121,2021-01-28 19:12:48,for those hating on rh for the last minute change they may have just saved you fucking forgot to include a god damn tldr tldr if robinhood didnt change the rules to spread out the sales of all your itm contracts you fuckers cant afford to exercise they would have sold them all at 300pm friday the market makers would be the only buyers they sell the shares they were holding to hedge the contracts they sold they sell all of them at once large push down then paper hands then stop losses and flash crash bonus material at the bottom of post now to the real shit first off not a bear or bull i have gme and will add later yadda yadda im just pointing out an observation second off this is just a theory no fucking way i know if this is true its gonna sound scary sure but i want some genius fucker hedge manager who is progme to tell me how horribly wrong i am robinhood changed the rules and you cant buy any 1dte or 0dte positions on gme for 129 yall got the memo that sucks because we all know you guys were going to hold on to your positions for every last ounce of rocket fuel i dont do emojis sorry robinhood may have just saved you by not letting you most of you fuckers who have options have 100c 150c 200c whatever you know you need money to exercise that at a cost of $20000 to exercise for one contract is a little more than most can handle especially the newbies here under normal circumstances robinhood would sell your position on friday back to market at about 300pm give or take 5 minutes the problem is that ive seen the order sheets its you lot that owns most of the 129 call positions tiny order sizes 1 to 5 contracts that means most of you wont be able to exercise your position and that means it has to go to market all at once again this is under normal circumstances what happens when you sell a bunch of contracts at bid to the market the bid goes down quite possibly below intrinsic value the market makers buy it especially in the last hour of the day and they do the opposite of what they did last week they sell shares against the lower delta if they are the ones that buy their own contracts back especially if below intrinsic they sell however many shares the delta was for that contract they dont want to hold on to those shares if they dont have to thats not their game but theyre not just selling for the 350c thats itm while the underlying is $360 theyre selling for the 220c they got at the same time the 200c they also got they dont need those covered anymore so they sell on those as well the more they sell the more contracts start becoming otm and the more they can sell against the lower delta those just became if you flush the market with contracts where there is essentially only one buyer mms this kind of thing can happen and you can end up with a potential gamma flush opposite of a squeeze queue in paper hands and stop losses and you have a very nasty flash crash in essence if robinhood does not do the 300pm flush of contracts and instead actually spreads the sales out over the next 2 days then they saved what could have been a potential flash crash wiping everyone out good luck out there be safe make some fucking money and imagine there are some damn rocket emoji everywhere mother fucking conspiracy theory crazed nutter bonus content after a whole lot of thought i realized something you actually want the flash crash to happen if anyone cares to know let me know and ill make another god damn post
0,37,2021-01-28 19:05:39,dillards the short play no one is talking about dillards has been quietly gaining attention thanks to many articles spouting its short interest articles below dillards is currently sitting at a short percent of float of 14636 and will be substantially higher after todays price action dillards $dds share float is only 424 million or 1926 what this means is every dollar thrown at dillards will affect its price 5x more then a stock with a 100 outstanding float the lower the float the easier it is to moon look at this mornings price action dds ran 20 to $128 on 240k of volume before being halted and shorted back down if this stock gets any attention it will run faster than my dad from his parental duties look at the after hours activity it ran from $82$93 on 400 shares thats the type of moon possibility we are dealing with any volume premarket can send this up 50 worst case scenario and it doesnt squeeze you are invested in a company that trimmed its fat and improved its margins thanks to covid reporting 32 million in net income last quarter up from 55million in the prior year this post will probably get downvoted to oblivion thanks to the gme stampede but ill keep it up for reference once dds moons price target 17k a dds sells for roughly 17k on runescape a retail company with hundreds of buildings and locations should be worth atleast that much
750,88,2021-01-28 18:54:44,the total short value could be underreported fines for underreporting are a fucking joke during my research on short interest and stats on short history for my previous ta i did on gme and posted i came across a release from finra in 2015 finra fined morgan stanley $2m for under reporting their short interest lets say that again fined $2m if a fund is a few billion dollars deep in a short their underreporting of short interest is way more fucking beneficial than paying $2m this system is fucking rigged and needs to be taken down the regulators are basically saying you can destroy companies and fuck over retail all you want but you gotta pay $2m first fuck this gme forever heres the source 
629,97,2021-01-28 18:48:30,we must fight against censorship wsb is showing how censorship can effect us all if we dont reject it there is a desperate and coordinated effort to thwart everything retail investors are doing censor and ban their communication platforms and lobby for regulations to protect the elite wall street investors against the retail investors cnbc has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to protect the retail investors from themselves as shortselling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars cnbc has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected these ultrawealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine and they are transparently using it to their advantage not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors they are also using their power to censor these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech tech companies likely influenced by their politician buddies in washington have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users facebook has been doing the same and most recently the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy twitters largest potential competitor parler it was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to parler they all used the same justification even though their own platforms were equally as guilty if not moreso of the same wrongdoings it was blatantly coordinated censorship and they dont care because they have the power droves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities and they can censor anyone they want many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the first amendment and they are legally correct barring any future antitrust legislation but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship free speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100s of years but recently it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored and then we have wsb and gme the people of wsb rarely if ever talk politics we are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies people from every background come together and discuss one thing investing and tendies there is no left or right no red or blueonly green but now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts the wallet the elite are using their power to censor first we have discord over 250000 people on the wsb discord and it was censored for hate speech the most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence call them hateful racist etc note that discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including firstmark capital greenoaks capital partners index ventures ivp greylock partners benchmark accel general catalyst ridge ventures spark capital and tencent holdings who do you think pulled the strings on discord for them to censor the wsb channel and now you have reddit commentators on cnbc have already called for the wsb subreddit to be banned and with reddits investor profile who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit so you see this isnt just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs this is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said yes im okay with it because i dont like their politics but many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them we must collectively reject and fight back against censorship lest it comes to effect us all i truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship we need to get back to we the people controlling this country and not we the elite i know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some but when it comes to our culture and values that slope can be slippery my friend tldr gme to the moon censorship by the powerful is bad
56,279,2021-01-28 18:39:14,what is the next step obviously this gme hype cant go on forever well maybe it can lol tesla but what does it mean that a multi billion dollar hedge fund tried shorting gme who is the next gme and could this be an indicator that the entire stock market will start to go down very soon because major money will be getting pulled out because they dont wanna end up as the next melvin or is this just a lone hiccup in the stonks only go up universe i feel some type of stock market trap will be upon us in the coming months
583,82,2021-01-28 18:38:37,impending crash smh dont let them dictate you or the market  these banks want to convince you that the bubble will collapse so you sell as if we havent barely scratched the surface of the number of people who will leap on this train they are not trying to protect you they are trying to protect themselves gme to the mf moon 
81,127,2021-01-28 18:24:01,whats the bear position on gme seriously before you crush this with downvotes or let it get lost in the churning abyss whos gonna step up and be the that i need what causes this to end in tears a lot of seasoned traders and newbies alike are betting hard on this life savings getting thrown around like no big deal so lets hear it paper hands bailing out at the first sign of trouble and causing our wall to falter is at the top of my list that dip back into the double digits a few days ago had people shook regulatory intervention not really afraid of that this should hopefully be over before the speed of government does anything some sort of surprise news if the open short percentage was shown to be dramatically decreased that could cause a run for the exits gme could also make a statement of some sort and rock the boat robinhood fuckery that 129 options business is odd as hell anything else im still holding more than i ever thought i would be but weve forgotten here that stonks dont always go up good to keep risk in mind during the mania
1025,122,2021-01-28 18:20:34,rocket tattoo fuck it dude if gamestop gets to $1000 ill get a tattoo of a rocket on my arm ill even let wallstreetbets design the tattoo this is fucking beautiful fuck melvin fuck cnbc gme to the moon
1727,640,2021-01-28 18:17:24,we need to talk about nok i get it its not the play im not saying sell your gme im not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole im a regular guy whos got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young if you dont agree with me just say so im also not a financial advisor so make up your own minds you autistic fucks but but yesterday we did something theyve never seen yesterday we made them run out of nok shares thats what that big spike was and thats why trading was stopped for 2h if we keep doing that it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history because they will keep dumping it until its too late impossible you say too many shares you say well listen up yesterday in one day we traded or caused others to trade 1bn shares of nokia that is 15 of all the nokia shares in the world thats never happened ever not even when nokia was the biggest phone company in the world 351616 of average trading volume do you get it theyll keep dumping their stock we keep buying them cheap and then they wont be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in we can move 1bn shares in a day one day why do they stop trading in nyse cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they dont want artificial spikes in the prices so they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market and once they had enough they started again thats why that spike went down right after the freeze but then we did it again and they had to stop again the price just wouldnt go down the assholes whod just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes whod convinced them everyone is watching us what we do millions of normal folks do with us and every wallstreet asshole does against us what did the asshole brigade do they started shorting nok they will continue to do that because they think were retards they are correct but how come the price didnt go down its got 5bn shares and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it how could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there how is this going to work because the retard brigade was buying it theres 3m of us and counting if we each put 600 bucks on nok we get 100 shares and thats 300m shares now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it and fucking hold and every dip you see you buy more and fucking hold theyll keep dumping we keep buying until they realize the price isnt going down then they start buying we keep holding the market runs out of nok price skyrockets and normies outside were following us they can see that the stock is still low lower than 2016 this means they dont think its a bubble thats going to crash on them so why do the normies follow us on this and not on gme im not saying sell gme because gme has never ever been anywhere near where it is now that scares a normal guy whos just trying to put in some savings for his family they think this is some dutch tulip market shit not so with nok even with the spike from yesterday nok is still down from 2016 remember 2016 remember that being a really big year for nokia no me neither and lets not even get started on where it has been in the past yesterdays spike barely shows on the graph you know what is going to be a big year 2021 and 2022 why what else did nok say yesterday well they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit what do i know im not a techie but it is a new kind of technology thats going to kick 5gs ass and my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade do you think were going to need more data this year than last year remember how netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in march because the networks couldnt handle the amount people were streaming what do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that but why would nok be the company well remember the 5g war with china us and europe cant buy 5g from china because then china has our networks but guess who us and europe arent afraid of fucking finland finland the land of nokia so tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesnt really exist sorry finnish people nobody gives a shit about you good thing for you cos you get to build the 5g network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that finland will take over the world want proof they are literally building one on the fucking moon and were going to send them there but hang on why is nok so low in the first place if its so great answer because microsoft fucked them thats right they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the nok leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down and then buy the phone part of the company these assholes wrecked the company the finnish economy and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college imagine everyone whod be fucked if someone did that to apple now worked like a charm firesale business restructuring lost their phones nok never recovered the asshole they sent from microsoft went back to work for microsoft and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did his name is stephen elop look it up so they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes but what dont they have money thats why theyre building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake finland to show everyone it works but if we drive the share price up do you think thats going to change so fuck it im in for every penny and i am holding ill see you in my house on the moon next to a nokia comms tower or ill see you in valhalla you beautiful retarded motherfuckers tldr nok is literally going to the moon go there with them x200b edit ive got a lot of messages here are my answers to the most common ones remember im an idiot i dont know shit i see cheap nok i like cheap nok i buy cheap nok im not a stockbroker or anything all i know is its a healthy undervalued company with massive upside potential new space tech etc there is downside risk but the risk is smaller than the potential so if you invest 5k you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days would i bet a dollar to win 100 if yesterday everyone who bet added 50 to their money yeah might lose a quarter but could gain 100 dollars do i know its definitely going to happen of course not what happened yesterday 1bn nok shares traded has never happened before it was supposed to be impossible edit for the lols sauce on the 1tb 3310 still charged unbreakable nok
1260,248,2021-01-28 17:54:14,politics cant stop gme and math says pt 1000 math ortex showed a 6mil decrease in estimated si from 72mil on 26th jan to 66 mil on 27th jan thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito this gave us over 100 150 per share in gains using after hours close to be conversative to hit 1k assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest we only need 30mil shares to be covered less than half of the current estimated short interest if we go by percentage increase we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k 230 increase heres the kicker this shit isnt linear on the side of the prolapsed buttholes panic increases as the price increases even if the shorts try to diamond hand they will get margin called on the side of us rocket bois paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain representing increased reluctance to part with shares in brief the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply zoom zoom to 11 political you hear the big fucks coming in talking about sec investigation stopping gme from trading and what not we already have dd on why there is nothing illegal happening here but i present the human angle before anything politicians need our vote it is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck the optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face the people against evil melvin tendies dont have a party this sub doesnt have a party right now we dont care who the autist next to us votes for all we know is gme gang gang will tear a new one and well be rich and celebrate together from doing so other than a few dumb idiots no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop gme the backlash from the public would be massive we are in the right here melvin and co can whine about it but any intervention on gme will be seen as foul play good luck getting a single vote out of any gme holder if they try fucking with us positions 200 gme shares 3495 edit msg from ugmesquoze who cant post dude has gme positions so pt calculation for gme all 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup times for each candle are 915 918 927 why these candles they are completely green with no wicks 915 low 248 high 268 volume 336k price range is 20$ 1$ per 168k volume 918 low 26777 high 327 volume 948k price range is 60$ 1$ per 158k volume 927 low 324 high 3548 volume 564k price range is 30$ 1$ per 188k volume my reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when i was watching they just went up indicating institutional buying assuming i am correct we have 1$ move per average 1713k volume we have 70m shares shorted on gme which accounts to 4k$ price move we are currently trading at 330$ if they outright cover all the shares which they wont we will arrive at a pt of 43k$ for 0 short interest on gme this pt also doesnt include the gamma squeezes from mm and the bullish buying from investors so i would say the most conservative pt for gme would be the most unlikely scenario which is 43k$ if the shorts just cover the entire si otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as i mentioned candles from yesterdays market

1677,386,2021-01-28 16:23:53,gme wars suits strike back warning for all you fellow autists obligatory im not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah okay gme gang weve got the shorts on the ropes theyre bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear theyve tried false information getting on cnbc and screaming for regulation of our market manipulation trying to get us shut down biden administration tweet saying shorts have already covered etc none of it has worked so far and theyre still bleeding money now theyre truly desperate whats something they havent tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do market crash yes thats right i believe with what im currently seeing they are going to crash the market and blame it on us do i think you need to be concerned about gme no because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell gme and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere i dont think i have to tell many of you that the current levels are atabove where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the buffet indicator all this says is that were probably in a market bubble and its been at these levels for months now but guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits thats right a bubble and who are they blaming us now that i have your attention lets look at a few other things this is the volatility index the past week notice how its been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn if this thing gets above that well probably be seeing the market dropping quickly additionally there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time thats one of the first things i noticed before the march crash and ive been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today notice the large red volume candles on the weekly spy chart robinhood screenshot on a dd post yes i know im on my phone with limited time deal with it lol now you might say its earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and thats expected in this tough time well yes but theres the apple earnings today they beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do you guessed it i hope currently were seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the sp 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide you could say this is smart money pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks however there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the march crash it just needed a catalyst aka global pandemic now were in a similar boat market issues in need of a catalyst what is that catalyst this time around thats right a bunch of millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble basically this isnt smart money pulling out here its mad money hi cramer they are declaring war they are pissed that we are stealing their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again including wrecking the market and the economy once again the suits are out for blood now do i think this will effect gme much only if you dont sell all this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping gme suppressed fails even more than it already has there are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold be careful out there autists tldr gme to valhalla rest of the market potentially to the depths of avernus soon positions gme feb 19th $115 calls

734,380,2021-01-28 14:11:45,implications of bullshit sec shutdown of trading gme mass regulator suggests halting the stock for 30 days white house looking etc what are the implications if one of these bullshit moves is made by the gov i know powell already had a no comment along with press sec but my feeling is these scum hedge funds have most of these folks bought and paid for to pressure regulation i personally see this backfiring on them in a big way but how would this affect our gme tendies if this shit somehow happened edit i bring this up because authority fucking with my hard earned money makes my blood boil the silencing of free speech the blatant manipulation and projection the fake virtue signaling were trying to save you from your own ruin assuming we cant handle risks we take with our money i was livid earlier and i know they will continue to try quite possibly anything they can to fuck holders
11962,1029,2021-01-28 13:44:13,the biggest risk we face and why its nothing to worry about for now greetings all bit of background ive been on this sub for years was even a mod temporarily when uonly1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long long ago and ive been in the hedge fund world for about a decade im a sellside analyst wont go into more detail than that as it isnt necessary i mention all of this because i know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next i wont make any predictions on gme bb or other stocks because i dont think the squeezes biggest risk right now is there rather the biggest risk comes from what weve already seen happen over at discord with the shutdown of the server note that discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including firstmark capital greenoaks capital partners index ventures ivp greylock partners benchmark accel general catalyst ridge ventures spark capital and tencent holdings at least one of these firms has invested with point72 ventures which recently helped melvin capital so its not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the discord channel banned for hate speech which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi now this subreddits long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure reddit to get it closed i recommend the rword and fword be banned by mods for this reason yes i know it is stupid and well rworded but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community what is the risk of reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down at the moment id say pretty low but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk reddit is owned by advance publications which is owned by donald newhouse and the newhouse family some details here fortunately newhouses family office think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the familys money is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik the family offices cio details here got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds at least according to her linkedin profile so the donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit however it remains a risk and a very serious one i suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going if palihapitiya was serious about investing in the wsb community id suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance a kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made in short wsb is at the mercy of reddits admins who are at the mercy of its executives who are at the mercy of the owners while wsb is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires this is a very serious weakness that the discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap
4850,277,2021-01-28 13:23:17,my response to fox business asking for an interview mods remove my prison tat ive been a good boy hey brad first a bit about me im young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 25 years and am now retired thanks elon with that out of the way the beautiful thing about this movement is its not a movement with any one representative point of view its more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and its well thought through it gets upvoted and awarded its truly democratic and decentralized the gme phenomenon started exactly this way when a few people including michael burry big short fame noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value others on here took notice and believe it or not did thorough due diligence i encourage you to use the dd filter and see some of this its pretty incredible work with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it when chewy founder ryan cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth then people here took notice of the fact that 148 of the float was sold short still a bit hazy on how this is legal and did what wall st and the mainstream media didnt do they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it more people here noticed and more people acted this is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors the only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information with that said i have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 28 million members of wallstreetbets which by design is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative i sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or antiestablishment i really appreciate you reaching out and i want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 28 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit i really think fox business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at cnbc godspeed and make us proud a humble retard
527,151,2021-01-28 13:08:51,the gme situation a discussion for our times this gme situation seems to me that it could be best described as the gme reset or our great reset wouldnt it be interesting if a point of view was offered similar to it would be inequitable to introduce regulations to retail investors as a result of the gme reset the gme reset is about speaking truth to power and promoting equal access to financial institutions wsb supports the 2030 agenda to mars eta not financial advice 1 share gme bc i like the stock
20800,1277,2021-01-28 12:05:30,if we all come up with a dollar or two we could get the best securities lawyers on retainer for a class action if the sec pulls shenanigans the age of the retail is upon us the brokers have given us commissionfree trading reddit twitter etc have given us a collective hive mind where ideas can be nurtured critiqued developed distributed and acted upon in concert however the government hedge funds brokers et al still practice their dirty tricks to protect their own we should fear the systematic risk of cronyism within the halls of government and wall street to put the brakes on our profit making which is our lawful american right should the sec illegally or unjustly intervene on behalf of their friends who so often reward government poodle regulators with lucrative jobs after leaving civil service we will need to find a large law firm that specializes in securities and class actions and is willing to setup a trust account where you give your name nominal retainer fee and proof that you owned $gme to establish standing in a suit edit align incentives edit2 to those who misunderstand this isnt about hiring a defense attorney this is about holding government regulators accountable in federal court if they chose to illegally or unjustly injure gme holders that can only be done if gme holders have representation disclosure we are individual investors that like the stock each wsb user acts of his own accord with regards to his market activity fearing illegal or unjust sec action and hiring counsel is our american right as is our freedom of association
23106,814,2021-01-28 11:53:56,20 years from now imagine youre sitting in your wifes boyfriends kitchen 20 years from now and their ten year old kid that youre raising walks in hey i just watched a movie about the gamestop squeeze of 2021 werent you in the stock market back then his excitement tries to cut through the field of regret the memory has sparked but it cant i was you answer hesitantly that was a crazy time well did you trade it did you have it when it went to two thousand hes so giddy its almost palpable you take a sip of coffee before answering well uh i was but sold my shares in the morning after they fell fifty bucks in after hours trading at two hundred youve never seen your son look at you like this before and hope youll never have to again uh okay bye he walks off you sigh closing your eyes what you wouldnt do to change the past edit dont give this dumb post money put it into gme
795,63,2021-01-28 10:53:30,this is personal now we need their scare tactics to have the total opposite effect we must use this opportunity to show we will not be intimidated this isnt just about gme but about all our trades in the future this is serious i know we are all obsessed with making money but theres more to this now for far too long the elites of the world have written the rulebook for us while abiding by a completely different set of rules for themselves its a tale literally as old as time but we can pull off something special here if we wilt now everything we have worked for and put up with to this point is for naught even worse than that it means that we let their scare tactics win if you werent already all in on gme you need to be now we need you we can do this but only together
240,38,2021-01-28 10:49:38,a watershed moment in financial mathematics what cnbc and the hedge funds dont want you to know  when a party shorts a stock it creates a liability to repurchase the stock at whatever the price is unbounded this liability is secured by the assets in the partys margin account when the liability exceeds the amount of assets in the margin account they face a margin call provide additional money or securities to cover the gap or we will liquidate your position and bill you for the remainder the monumental discovery which is in process is as follows when over 100 of shares are short the long position is effectively backed by the shorts and becomes an infinite loop if the market cap of a stock is $50bn there are $50bn in margin assets backing this price thus stock is in a perpetual state of fair value as long as the over 100 condition holds and the shorts have the assets regardless of price so now the hedge funds find themselves in a chinese finger trap to push their fingers together means to liquidate their positions and take enormous losses to pull their fingers is to continue to provide margin as the price increase until they reach bankruptcy and lose everything in their hubris they were trying to pull as these funds and brokers employ tons of smart phds to understand this math they have undoubtedly realized this and hence they want to cut the trap they have restricted retail trading to prevent this limitless outflow they are trying to bully the regulators into backstopping their position they may halt trading what is the maximum fair market cap of gme it is as much capital as these hedge funds want to throw away lambs to the slaughter before they throw in the towel and its first come first serve what is the aum of the remaining short funds 50bn 100bn 200bn more as we have seen time and time again the behavior of market participants is not rationale and is difficult to predict people are ignorant of this mathematical fact crying about the fundamental value of the retailer on cnbc but big money is smart they will figure out exactly how big the pot is and they will snap it up even a country could do it disclaimer i am not a financial professional nor is this financial advice im just pointing out that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of this financial math make your own choices and invest responsibly only what you can afford to lose lord knows they are doing anything they can legal or not to shut this down tldr the math of over 100 short interest allows for 100 arbitrage losses from the short funds this creates the possibility for the greatest transfer of wealth of all time
97,37,2021-01-28 09:16:00,back to basics gme is a 15x evsales 12month forward sales at current prices posted this the last part in a reply to a comment but think it deserves a post new shorts are pilling in the news are building a narrative that a bunch of millennials as if we dont have several prominent boomers among us are targeting hedge funds in chat rooms mirc much to create an irrational bubble and that this is a perfectly orchestrated multibillion dollar operation wanna talk about irrational irrational is to value gamestop at $4 with $2 in cash per share a few months before a new console cycle is launched irrational is to keep naked short selling well above its available free float morning start shows the most accurate free float imo a company that has completed a major share buyback turning inventory into cash paying back their 6 lt debt early and attracting a major activist sup rc youve been quiet lately how come there were no news about this is everyone sleeping how come bank of america has had a price target of $2 for gamestop sorry bofa increase their pt to $10 today for months and by the way what has fundamentally changed for bofa to increase 5 fold their valuation of gamestop what a bunch or crooks you wanna know whats not irrational gme has $7b in sales in the end of a console cycle and amidst lockdowns out of those sales 1b is ecommerce that is growing 300 yoy 50m power up members amazon prime has 150m members an established and functioning sales and distribution network worldwide a healthy balance sheet all that while operating in an industry with a crazy tam with growth rates above 30 and with the most desirable demographic and seriously a 3x evsales is a bubble for this the ecommerce part of it alone should trade at this valuation and lets not forget that the only reason gme has not sold more in q3 is because there is a shortage of product demand is not gonna evaporate so discount that valuation to this year sales and you have a 15x time salesev valuation so ask yourself one question would you pay an 80 interest to remain short in this thesis edit grammar

1,0,2021-01-29 01:25:26,why wall street cant believe whats happening my day job is at a large financial advisory company in the us whose hallmark is having many singleadvisor offices spread out all over all 50 states we would never allow a fa to recommend investing in $gme or $bb or any of our beloved singular stonks which is the right move for a company focused on longterm sustainable investing for average folks today at my regions morning coffee zoom call people were freaking out re$gme and there was one repeated call of exasperation that people just couldnt wrap their brains around how how are people who have never met each other sticking together not selling applying pressure how is this hivemind forming when so much is on the line it doesnt make sense i still havent come out to anyone at work as retarded or as an autist who only takes breaks from watching the markets to go buy my husband and his boyfriend bubble teas but its really something special and historic in this community average wall street folks rig the game in insane ways and spend every second of every day thinking of new ways to fuck over average people and figure out how to stop them from communicating and spreading information and sticking together they feel like the only answer must be some illegal organizing or shadowy evil collusion when the truth is its a lot of independent folks all across the financial and autistic spectrum all coming to their own decisions to invest hold and trust each other this is because for so so many of us its not about making our own accounts go green while leaving the autists who enabled our growth alone this is motivated by love for others and hate of the huge institutions that exist to bleed everyone dry it really is a mission that so many of us are feeling individually called to that it should serve as an an indictment on all of wall street imagine fucking over working people so badly for so long that when many people could already make the call to pull out with lifechanging earnings they instead decide to hold and risk to bleed them back this type of individual solidarity could not exist without decades of cruelty and manipulation from wall street and industry people dont realize how far folks have been pushed in order to issue a warning shot to the whole industry of vampires its making history and people on the inside cant believe what theyre seeing its an honor to post w yall fuck em all

3,0,2021-01-29 01:24:41,email i sent to marketwatch on american public media regarding the inappropriate narrative surrounding gme listening to dr moallemis columbia university interview on marketwatch this morning triggered me no one in the mainstream media has the narrative right here is an email i sent to marketwatch this morning please tell me if you think this is inappropriate or ill informed also if you think it is a proper explanation of how you feel too feel free to copy and paste the narrative has to change to marketplace production team and staff i am a long time listener and donor to public media ive listened to your coverage of the gme phenomenon and believe you are misrepresenting the base of this movement ive listed a couple points below that i wish you would address in your sentiment during your coverage of gme stock surge 1 dr moallemi repeatedly degraded the base of this phenomenon claiming both advertently and tongue in cheek that i do not understand the risk involved in this process first of all yes the rwallstreetbets community was originally a place for investors to propose risky market plays but these market plays are always accompanied by that users due diligence and thesis behind the market play this current phenomenon while originally inspired by some derivative plays which michael burry engaged in himself is now supported by a foundational argument that users should simply buy shares the community is no longer supporting options plays and claims a buy and hold strategy is best in this current situation let me state we are not a collective simply individual investors that do our own research and make our own financial decisions while dr moallemi can claim i do not understand the risk in this process i can assure you i certainly understand the risk of buying a stock at $20 $40 $80 $300 how much money can i lose $20 $40 $80 $300 respectively he can go on your show with his fancy university titles and say we are risky and uninformed but he fails to acknowledge that many hedge funds melvin capital in particular shorted over 100 of gamestop shares is this even legal do these hedge funds understand their risk their exposure to losses is technically infinite my exposure to loss is finite who is the riskier investor why is no one in the media talking about this 2 to build on this point the original thesis for this play was lightly based around the insane short position on gamestop but also had foundational knowledge about the growth potential for a company that is mixing up leadership stepping out of their old ways and into new avenues and operates in a space gaming that is seeing incredible amounts of growth at this moment what is the true fundamental value of gamestop who honestly can give a proper answer to that question especially in this market my argument however is the following if an investor is buying shares at some price say $300 does that investor not believe such an investment is worth $300 people are buying gme while some of this may be influenced by online hysteria the surge in gme stock is fundamentally based in the belief of retail investors that this company can succeed diametrically opposing the insane short position in gamestop i recommend you actually take a look at rwallstreetbets or even rinvesting or rpennystocks and look at some of the amazing research the uninformed retail investors are developing for countless stocks not just gamestop also see chamaths full interview on cnbc if you can even find it anymore 3 this narrative that uninformed stupid risky retail investors are blowing up the market has to stop we are not uninformed as dr moallemi claims there is a thesis behind this financial play and you see it unfolding before your eyes you have a chance here to represent the retail investor for what they truly are informed intelligent and savvy i will not link the original dd for the gamestop play because i do not want to put any of my fellow investors in the spotlight but it doesnt take a lot of work to find the beginning of this financial play on rwallstreetbets please please please this narrative needs to change from online retail investors are manipulating the market look at the dd look at the hedge fund positions look at the countless market makers that are trying to manipulate this phenomenon back into their favor and you will see the retail investor is in the right if anyone needs to be regulated it should be the people that can short a company for over 100 of their shares completely nullifying that companys chances at raising capital and succeeding as a business i hope you read this wall of text i have listened to all of your coverage on this topic and believe some of your interviews have some high points i appreciate your show and just want you to know you have a really big opportunity right now to get this narrative right no one else in the media has taken the time to truly investigate this phenomenon my hope is that public media will fulfill that service thanks for your time

3,3,2021-01-29 01:23:24,well heres my take yall hey guys not sure if this is going to make it through the modblocker but here goes long as i know but bear with me censored so we can play by someone elses game long time lurker didnt make a reddit account until like 3 days ago because i am an introvert and never participate in this community only doomscrolled endlessly for years with hearty belly laughs i found wsb after a confusing 2018 and shedding tears wearing a ratty flannel inside a model s in a tesla showroom needless to say ive since upgraded to the hm sales rack so i like a lot of you was a kid during 2008 my parents had a business in a booming market whose success led them to buy a house they got absolutely crushed and it marked the end of their relationship and a string of hopelessness that is etched into my mind well i wound up choosing the camo pajama path for a few years for free college this post mainly applies to americans i guess because this is our system and were promised inalienable rights through our constitution and the free market lineofthought and such 1 the people of this country are awesome people wearing camo pajamas for a living gave me a wide knowledge of how fabulous and great the average guygal is here integrity is topnotch amongst those who came from modest backgrounds if you dont come from the usa i would understand this statement would be confusing especially after what happened on the 6th of jan i have to tell you i was exposed to the wealthy and the non and damn the power of manipulation the mighty dollar holds is completely underestimated 2 the people of this community are from modest backgrounds they live daytoday jobs they dont go baller with their earnings if they lose it all they remain the same i personally will remain in my small apartment i tried taking earnings yesterday and celebrating with a $50 dish from a fancy restaurant but having to deal with the surrounding people and food wasnt worth the price and man every table of richies was talking about this forum 3 this is a government of the people by the people for the people and it shall not perish from the earth gettysburg address lincoln heres the deal for all you onlookers who are truly curious about what is happening red pill blue pill time every piece of news you are ever told ever is now controlled by billionaires who have a vested purpose of convincing you of something watching that interview on cnbc with chamath palihapatiya yesterday shook me to my core when he started talking about when we were kids it struck a tone hes right sentiment is there this forum is by far the most intelligent most interesting most amazing thing ive ever had the opportunity to be a part of and i never even participated 4 the truth is the people that have been in wsb for years have been continuously with by wall street intentional massive swings in price to strip money from these guys in options and if you dont understand what im talking about just trust me these guys have been capital capital by wall street over and over again we all collectively live in their game they control video media they control print media they control financial media every piece is a hit piece trust me on this trust wsb on this they are not trying to protect us never have never will 5 to our politicians on socalled freemarket economics what you are witnessing is a true expression of a truly free capitalist market a bunch of traders find intrinsic value in a stock and by all and every account of the rules that we claim to have adopted in this country can and are allowed to continue you should take all and every call to stop this with utmost scrutiny if you truly represent us americans you need to open your eyes and have an open mind this event is literally the beginning of the scene in wizard of oz where we are slowly peaking behind the curtain income inequality is real wall street manipulates americans to meet their objectives this is fact not opinion the eyes of the world are literally upon you if we had this situation in the 60s and it was squelched by our government you can bet your sweet that there would be communist propaganda stating capitalism was a lie to benefit the fat cats every single red blooded american is following this right now i would argue the vast majority of them are rooting for wsb the little guy for once 6 to our politicians on the people here the vast majority of people here are generous kind and caring people they care about their communities they care about more than economy as mentioned before they know no bailout never have another thing and aoc this is for you fight for us here we will pay all taxes on gains as per our tax bracket the people are watching a freemarket economy will work well when we all can play together 7 this group of traders calls themselves idiots they understand the system is rigged they are trying to fight back in an intellectual manner unfortunately if income inequality continues unmitigated and you dont fight for us ive got a feeling that the people that come to fight next will not be the same group they will not understand why theyre struggling they just are they will not know or understand the mechanics of the markets finance or wealth they will not call themselves idiots and theyre going to be spurred by much worse chatboards in much worse corners of the internet surely on 6jan if you went over to your average joe theres no way in hell they considered themselves stupid 8 im begging you fight for our democracy fight for a free market fight for the right to party fight to equate the system fight for free access to unbiased information for all traders fight for neutral media fight to keep people from being controlled please if you dont do anything to keep billionaires from destroying us over and over again capitalism as we know it is at stake movements will become more radical this will not be a oneoff thing in our country keep in mind thousands of our countrymenwomen have died fighting to preserve capitalism and free trade throughout the world to be protecting investors like this is to not rationalize our nations previous conflicts to keep this system the way it is currently and to allow blatant market manipulation to continue in this country is to not have a damn clue what we are all about this is a democracy through and through be leaders lead this shit 9 i believe very strongly in capitalism and a free market what youre seeing is income equalization in a free market before your very eyes it required no government handholding it required no extra taxes or bureaucracy it required no thought by anyone in government it required no legislation it did however require a lot of thought and duediligence by some amazingly intelligent people who did so on a free public forum for the benefit of all this is the true merit of capitalism and every single american that claims to love our system and our way of life needs to know youre witnessing the cracking of the facade occur before your very eyes weve been tricked for so long to think that were living in a truly free capitalist market were not they own the tools they own the information and they own the capital were playing someone elses game always have always will dont believe what you hear think for yourselves we are players in their game but power to the players 1000 shares gme gimme some rocket and diamond hands emojis cause this is my first post plz i promise you i will contribute dd in the future because you all deserve it you

9,0,2021-01-29 01:30:24,my complaint to the sec regarding to the recent actions taken by robinhood feel free to use any or all of this in your complaints robinhood markets inc has engaged in market manipulation by locking its users out of buying a variety of stocks and options associated with gamestop gme and other popular companies robinhood has financial ties to citadel capital solutions a firm that took a financial interest in melvin capital as they were losing money on a reckless and over crowded short trade position on gamestop stock it is my belief that this lockout on specific stocks is directly related to the financial positions their partners have on these stocks and i can see it as nothing other than blatant market manipulation for personal gain at the expense of individual retail investors x200b i am immediately closing my account with robinhood but i am infuriated by the actions taken by the company and strongly suspect that in this process they have engaged in significant illegal activity through the following x200b intentional and willful conduct designed to defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price and intentional interference with the free forces of supply and demand x200b taking actions that affect the integrity of the market place and prevent price setting by the unimpeded collective judgement of buyers and sellers

16,1,2021-01-29 01:37:03,this is cheesy as hell but wsb has given me hope for humanity first off let me state that i was an initial naysayer about gme i dont even own any stocks because im not brave enough but ive been watching and ive seen how things have gone how people have been posting and dealt with there are occasional bad actors within this community that are going to try and take advantage of the rest of you but the majority arent like that and are doing a good thing separate but together the hope for humanity part comes in where game theory ends for those who dont know part of game theory involves the prisoners dilemma which could be easily adapted to apply to the gme stock situation in the prisoners dilemma two partners in crime are offered the option to betray one another each of you has two options to talk or to stay silent if both of you talk you both get a moderate amount of prison time if only one of you talks they get off and the other gets heavy prison time if neither talk you both get minor prison time the total of which is less than either one of you going to prison on their own so in this situation the choice thats best for the group is to stay silent as if you both stay silent your total prison time ends up less than either one of you going on their own and certainly is less than if you both betray eachother however most of the time this kind of situation with different scenarios where people are given a choice between acting in a way thats right for themselves if others also act that way and acting in a way thats only right for themselves if nobody else acts that way they choose the latter or in the prisoners dilemma they choose to betray their partner this is because most people feel that their partner will betray them anyway so they might as well act to minimize their own prison time and hey if the partner doesnt betray them they get the best possible option for only themselves the problem with this kind of thinking is that is ends up with everybody losing out on what could be a better situation for everybody because of the inherent selfishness of humankind overcoming this kind of thinking is how we may press forward as a society and advance beyond our own selfishness ive seen the gains a lot of you have made and youre all in an enhanced collective prisoners dilemma type scenario especially the ones with lots of shares if you cash out sure the stock will plummet but youll get out at the top meanwhile if everybody cashes out the stock will crash and most people will be losers but by keeping your faith in gme and the squeeze youre all looking to be winners hell on open today the stock soared up to nearly $500 a share in spite of manipulation and freezing and that bullshit

1,5,2021-01-29 01:57:29,how hedge funds can close their $gme position without covering their shorts just throwing this out there as a possibility not saying its actually happening and im not suggesting that the hedge funds have or have not closed their shorts but investors who are continuing to buy $gme based on the fact that they believe the hedge funds have not closed their shorts due to the elevated short interest need to consider that there are other ways to close the position without coving the short option 1 they could simply buy gme shares without closing the short effectively holding 2 positions one long one short their pl is then hedged and they are no longer suffering losses if the stock keeps moving higher they are not required to cover their shorts when they buy the stock they could even effectively have a long position in gme by doing so the $25b loan that they received could very well have been used in this fashion option 2 there are other ways as well using derivatives for one exchange listed or otc derivatives such as forwards swaps or options can be utilized as well to cover to create a synthetic hedge without actually covering the short stock position it is again entirely possible that they have an effective long positions in gme now profiting from the extreme moves to the upside and no longer losing money on this short

1,1,2021-01-29 01:57:15,they changed the rules of the game midgame hold  first let me begin by saying im not a massive holder of gme i own a bit because i think its a fun trade and its worth it to be part of this now everything thats going on re platforms not allowing investors to buy robinhood ib schwabb etc is considerably fucked up the strategy for this has always been one thing to exploit the shortsellers who made stupid bets on what they thought was a riskless strategy we are not investing in gamestop or basing this on fundamentals like their cash flows thats fucking obvious the fact that the media is saying that we are is the biggest strawman argument because its not at all fucking why were invested look at the short interestfloat on gme 250 look at the call options open on gme this is just for the end of this week 1157 call contracts $50 1487 call contracts $59 5880 call contracts $60 11145 call contracts $100 12338 call contracts $115 let me also remind you that each call option contract is 100 shares when they get called on friday they will need to purchase gme at the respective strikes totaling $303175300 investors can sell that for $16 billion usd if the price settles around $500 thats the fucking value of this trade and it gets better as the price goes up does it suck for these hedge funds that theyre all fucked yes but theyre hedge funds they manage risk and they totally failed their job because they sought out risk while the entire time thinking oh this is a riskless trade fuck that you played a strategy and you lost now youre asking exchanges to restrict trading because you left your king open for an easy checkmate too fucking bad these exchanges are bailing out hedge funds for being greedy and dumb fuck them all investors need to do is hold onto their shares until friday do whatever you want if you need to take profits but know that by selling you are fucking over the collective and bailing out these hedge funds x200b

1,1,2021-01-29 01:56:33,a strategy for gme fomo aka fuck the market makers too i like many doubted the power of wsb before the absurd surge in gme while ill never doubt the buying power of retards again im effectively priced out of gme now but the attacks against the institution dont need to stop if you can still buy options in gme there is a safeish way to make a ton of money and fuck over market makers in the process sell put options the historically high iv of gme has made option premiums completely unreasonable as a result you can sell otm puts for ridiculous percentages at strike prices that are almostkey word impossible to be exercised right now a mar 19th 20p has a bid price of $540 skip this part if youre not retarded selling a put means youre agreeing to buy 100 shares at the strike price so at the contract expiration you want the put to be otm in which case all your premium they paid you is free money if its itm you can choose to settle for cash or receive the shares so youre effectively committing to buy gme at 20$ a share on march 19th and being paid today for it a lot of brokerage services arent letting people short gme or buy it on margins if even allowing it at all this is a way to leverage the rest of your portfolio to benefit from the immediate volatility premiums are changing a lot so check out them all x200b holdings gme mar19th puts at $15 and $22 gme july 16th puts at $52

1,0,2021-01-29 02:07:34,vy global growth vygg lowrisk investment in what could turn out to be reddit the company hey all this is my first post here been a regular over at the sub spacs you guys should definitely come over some good dd on spacs which end up merging with some exciting companies such as evrenewable energy companies and doubling in a day on occasion all with very minimal downside risk ive known about this sub for a while but ive decided to write my first post after what happened to gme which is all over the place that is the craziest shit ive ever seen you guys are nuts congrats to all those who printed alot of tendies on to our topic for the day first off for those of you autists yeah i speak the language who do not know a spac is a shell company with no operations and which raises money through ipo it then looks for a company it decides to merge with if both sides can strike a deal the money raised through the spac is given to the target company in exchange for part ownership in that company meaning the holders of the spacs shares become shareholders of the acquired company once the deal goes through simple enough now i believe there is a good chance that vy global growth a spac that ipod late september 2020 is likely to eventually merge with reddit thereby turning vyggs shares into shares of reddit of course this is not a sure thing nothing is when it comes to markets but the below reasons lend support to this likely outcome 1 reddit ceo steve huffman the company will consider going public in the future source 2 guess whos one of the directors in vy global growth from vyggs prospectus steve huffman will serve as one of our directors following the completion of this offering mr huffman is the cofounder director and ceo of reddit the front page of the internet and the sixth most visited site in the us 3 spac sponsors generally provide an indication as to the industries they are targeting from the prospectus we are a newly formed blank check company that intends to partner with a technology business that will benefit from our global expertise to define the future of its industry 4 vy global growth indicates that it prefers founderled companies sound familar from the prospectus we look for businesses that are founderled with a longterm vision reddit is of course founded and currently led by none other than our steve huffman 5 link between vy capital and reddit vy capital funded reddit in a recent round ie it owns part of it that gives it preferential treatment in case it wanted to take it public through an associated vehicle source 6 vy global growth indicated it is not prohibited from acquiring a stake in a company affiliated with vy capital from the prospectus we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with vy capital why would they include such a clause probably intend to exercise their right as per this clause as you can see loads of datapoints supporting the possibility that vygg is likely to end up merging with reddit as i write this vygg shares are at $11 indicating a maximum possible loss of $1 since vygg is currently nothing but a pile of cash with $10 of cash per share this is how the most risk averse person should think of the downside here though the actual downside is probably $05 per share based on how its been trading since it ipod the upside if we get lucky and it does end up taking reddit public easily $20 on day 1 and higher afterwards this along with several other spacs i currently own offer some of the best riskreward setups ive ever seen in my life let me know what you guys think

1,5,2021-01-29 02:13:52,smoothbrains theres big brain shit going on read this important first off this is not investment advice this is just my stupid opinion and theoryies dont delete your robinhood just yet remember it takes several days to verify accounts for other trading platforms and several days to get your money flowing into it and get you trading effectively taking you off the market for a week or more also now that td ameritrade has banned trading on gme the only one left for us americans that i know of is webull who knows if theyll stand x200b now lets think about whats going on here all retail trading platforms are disabling buy options for gme openly manipulating the market to drive the price down now whats this squeeze weve been talking about all the hedgefunds shorting gme will have to buy all their shorted stonks at market value well if they drive the price way down guess what its the perfect opportunity for these fuckers to eat their shorts with way less damage so if you sell youre giving money right back to the hedgefunds they will use this opportunity today tomorrow next week i dont fucking know to reduce their loss hold for now x200b next part very important heres where it gets more insidious and i start to understand a little less gud so correct me if im wrong right when the hedgefunds are buying their shorts or whatever at market value would be a good time for all the retail brokerage platforms to enable buying again if they time everything right we will see the option to buy again and the stonk going up simultaneously and well all freak out and go buy buy buy but the hedgefunds will already have boughten in and will be riding our wave and then theyll dump us and leave us holding the bag what do we do i dont know im assuming hold but i dont know whats next this is for someone with a bigger brain a bigger dick and a bigger wifes boyfriend to figure out so upvote this shit so they can see it and figure it out position all in 0079548 shares gme im poor 
1,6,2021-01-29 02:13:52,gme this happened 3 days ago what youre seeing right now is a retrace to before gme gapped up 130 yesterday if you want to compare symbols remember vw also had a very sharp pullback before the massive squeeze up x200b todays chart looks nasty huh could be a gap fill x200b jan 25th processing img 7c9dcvfsk3e61 see how the stock rose up massive in the am and then dumped and then recovered at 930 pst 1230 est

1,0,2021-01-29 02:23:51,why this is bullshit what is happening why to hold basically all retail brokers are now limiting gme retail traders are restricted institutional traders are not the affect is a distortion of supply and demand retail cant buy but are being encouraged to flood the market with sells pushing the price downwards to effectively help hedge funds out of the short squeeze total bullshit if you listen to financial media a big concern is retail holding the bag that was never a given the most popular thesis behind gmes surge was that shorts must cover at any price they would be the ones holding the bag the people who shorted a stock in excess of 100 of its float the people who took on an unimaginable level of risk hedge funds created the conditions for what is now occurring not retail wsb users were just smart enough to exploit the opening that the hedge funds created with their move today robinhood set the stage for retail to lose other brokers followed their lead they are elevating the supply side gagging demand pushing the price down to fuck us over and let the greedy hedge fund players off the hook despite the risk theyve taken and the conditions they created it was their doing now robinhood is taking action that can leave their own clients holding the bag which is shameful to me this proves we are not their customer were the product citadel is robinhoods largest market maker who at the same time back the funds responsible for this short bet they had something to do with it if the line is held if enough traders dont sell we can keep supply at bay and the demand by short sellers to cover their positions will still be there the shorts are yet to be sharted this is not financial advice
1,1,2021-01-29 02:23:29,everybody drop robinhood and bring your to a new fidelity account leave your gme from robinhood untouched though stock price is going lower than $130 as i type just create a new fidelity account and do it from there keep only your gme on robinhood drop the other shit and bring that cash to fidelity to buy more
1,0,2021-01-29 02:23:19,read this im not 100 sure but this is the tactic lets say they have 1000000 shares for every 10000 shares they sell they drop the next 10000 by $10 to the point that the stock is losing money and not being consistent as it was example gamestop $1000 with a volume of 10000000 they sell 3000000 shares starting at $1000 and the next 100000 shares after the initial the price goes down by $10 leading all the way to a lower price point for said stock this is market manipulation correct my retarded math if im wrong they are just giving it all to scare us before they lose a shit ton of money by the end of tomorrow their contracts expire tomorrow if gme stays above $200 we win do not sell hold i am retarded i am not a financial expert or anything i am one of you diamond hands brothers and sisters

1,3,2021-01-29 02:21:36,volume is low hold  mm are attacking viciously but volumes are low many platforms are down which is very suspicious gme and bb tickers buy orders are blocked on some platforms mms are selling at lower price to create fear and force paper hands to sell do not give up volumes are low which means imo this is all manipulation this is class warfare this shit and buy more friday this will go up as options expire not fin advice im a retard
1,2,2021-01-29 02:21:29,stay strong with gme theyre pulling down the price because theyre afraid of tomorrow the lowest they can bring the price down to is 0 and when they do that we need to strike we brought the price up to $480 before and we can do it again this needs to be coordinated everyone needs to stay strong gme will be above 400 eod if we stay together in this 
1,4,2021-01-29 02:21:21,any brokers allow new accounts to deposit and make purchases the same day the account is opened if not robinhood censorship may cause gme purchases may lag for several days before price can continue to rise at full speed again

1,8,2021-01-29 02:45:05,halting explained there is massive manipulation in the form of halting occuring in td ameritrade dunno if its happening on other brokers but literally every few seconds the market opens it halts again this seems illegal so i did the lightest amount of research this is not illegal for them to do its called a circuit breaker halt and is allowed to be implemented when a stock moves in excess of about 5 they just typically dont abuse the fuck out of it to spite traders and prevent massive losses so what does this mean for how the market will move today and possibly from now on well its gonna suck it will be choppy and halted all day because there are no legal restrictions on abusing a cucircuit breaker halt however this does not change the fact that shorts are currently at 140 of float those shorts still need to cover all the data i can find on the accurate report of short float is data from 1231 unless someone had better information i think everyone is using these figures well get updated info by monday about how overextended these bastards are so those shorts will probably get fucked next week if friday doesnt deliver im relatively new to options trading so i dont really grasp the gamma squeeze but apparently thats going down 129 as well all this to say the industry is engaging in an absolutely fucking ridiculous amount of market manipulation to attempt toim not sure exactly what the shorts still have to cover options are still expiring tomorrow those are the key factors at play here and halting every minute for the next week wont change that theyre fucked and this is the tantrum before bed time gme $5000 i am not a financial adviser this is all my opinion based on publicly available knowledge im probably fucking wrong anyways dont listen to me bbrrrrr brrrrrrr edit positions 2000 gme 300 bngo

1,0,2021-01-29 02:50:09,wsb supporter michael pachter michaelpachter thank you for your support of individual investor rights and the disgusting behavior of trading platforms and brokers to unilaterally change access to our capital markets for only a select group of usersive been on wsb for a long time and been in several of these trades and i can assure you there are no 10b5 or other securities violations going onthis is a shocking and disturbing restriction and i hope you use your visibility and access to make this situation known and investigated this is corruption of not only our capital markets but of the very gatekeepers in those markets 751 am also if youd listen to news media youd think that nobody owned gamestop because they actually liked the stock and that a long investor isnt entitled to his profits it is not only changing the rules it can undermine the entire investment ecosystem there could be immense and farreaching adverse consequences to our capital markets if brokers and media decide which stocks deserve to go on rallies these are not regulators these are private companies denying access to publicly traded companies stock 807 am yes agree manipulation is the wrong word its a sound thesis to go long heavily shorted stocks and people doing so are big boys who can manage their own affairs i actually like gme and am street high for 2021 but hard to say they will earn enough to justify a $400 share price thanks for reaching out 833 am i dont think manipulation is too strong of a word cutting off demand for a stock with low supply due to shorts will affect the price thats economics 101 a corner in stock is textbook manipulation based on restrictions of supply and regardless youre talking about a fundamental difference in the stocks trading value against whether or not people are allowed to engage in the trade its a very slippery slope can a broker say teslas pe value isnt consistent with what we believe it should be so were not allowing you to invest in that after we have your money it seems to be a very dangerous road for a free market economy to take and its almost a tacit admission that our stock markets power is too centralizedbut thanks for your reply and i hope you use you continue to support parity in capital markets 850 am and im not foolish enough to think i could condescend to you with my economics 101 statement i only meant that this feels a lot like a very blatant violation of a fundamental element of the stock market 855 am but also as i understand it robinhoods deal flow is sold to citadel citadel and point72 bailed out melvin capital with $275b now how can you close a position when no broker is allowing anybody to sell it thats restricting the buyers while increasing the sellers why would market manipulation be the wrong word 907 am completely agree with you let free markets work freely processing img snzh47uqr3e61

1,11,2021-01-29 02:48:47,if by monday youre still on a platform that locked you out today you missed the point fidelity hasnt said a peep about stopping trades i bought shares and calls right up to writing this there is absolutely no reason for every single person here to move their money this sub moved millions into a stock that we believed in a stock that not only had a good fundamental thesis but the distinct pleasure of catching hedgefunds with there pants down why on earth wouldnt you treat the trading platforms the same way robinhood isnt like melvin capital theyre worse and i sincerely pray for the people telling me whats the point if i cant trade right now the point here is that everything you feel about gme now applies to robinhood and beating robinhood is so laughably easy the entirety of the gme short squeeze is now just a battle and it still rages but if monday comes and robinhood finds itself missing 60 of their users thats a solid win in an equally palpable battle against wall street fidelitycom get started this is not financial advice its life advice

1,0,2021-01-29 02:54:11,gme a psychologists take on a hedge funds next moves if i a clinical psychologist were a hedge fund manager or consultant and the expiration date of my shorts was this friday i would create the illusion of a squeeze before the actual squeeze occurred first i would get on wsb boards and understand the narrative for low medium and high range squeeze values but more importantly i would look to see where the greatest agreement is found among the wsb members based on my own perusing i would see a low value of $42069 medium value of $1000 and high value of over $2000 because retail investors are destroying my financials because i am so deep into this scheme the $42069 value is the target for my last ditch effort hedge fund managers know this could get even more out of their control i would then save all of my tactics for one last ditch effort including collaboration with other hedge funds for the high 300s or very low 400s remember i want you as a retail investor to think the squeeze is happening and that you need to sell quickly when the stock hits $400 and there is a sharp decrease between 50 and 100 most people will sell thinking they just witnessed the squeeze in turn saving the hedge funds billions of dollars had the stock price rose to $1000 or more the squeeze however may come on friday when their shorts expire hedge funds take many different variables into consideration when making bets on the stock market what their fancy algorithms and statistical software packages cant predict is how individuals will behave in an unprecedented time especially when those individuals are able to easily communicate with each other retail investors have the upper hand tldr hedge funds may continue to manipulate the price through various short selling tactics leaning on each other to slow the hemorrhage of cash they are experiencing time is on the side of shareholders not the hedge funds tldr because tldr was too long important this is not financial advice this thought is simply based on social psychology principles my novice understanding of the stock market and media reports about gme this is from a fellow redditorfriend of mine who cannot post on wsb
1,3,2021-01-29 02:53:52,this drop is not caused by mass selling shitadel and co have blocked americans from trading gme so they can drive the price down without resistance allegedly if you look at the volume today its about 27m as of 1130 which is absurdly low for gamestop during the squeeze this shows the volume for the last few days and you can see that gme has been consistently getting over 150m since the price took off the purpose of these hedge funds allegedly bringing the price down is to make you panic sell so they can buy it and cover much cheaper if they were doing this without blocking people from buying volume would reach 200m eod and there would be lots of resistance going down dont let this artificial market activity fool you into selling if you sell the only people who are allowed to buy are hedgefunds and europeans ew once you sell you can no longer buy back in positions gme 172 shares bb 5 feb 1921 $25c bb 1 jan 2921 $25c cgxto 25 mar 1921 $12c

1,0,2021-01-29 03:02:40,dips are not reflective of the overall trend disclaimer not a financial advisor earlier gme dipped every time it hit 400 now it dipped when it hit 250 im guessing its going to dip when it hits 300 people who dont want to hold and the shorts are putting sell orders at every milestone so they can make back some money every time it starts to go back up so every time it hits a milestone supply outweighs demand until all the orders are sold then itll go back to the overall average of demand outweighing supply alternate explanation 
1,0,2021-01-29 03:02:25,fired up i pooled my disposable income into gme so i dont have the funds to buy any more but im hoping this blatant market manipulation by robinhood is firing up people to buy more gme as another big fuck you
1,3,2021-01-29 03:02:24,the melvin gme plan over the next few hours disclaimer im an autist that is giving his opinion nothing more melvin and his hedgefund buddies are selling and buying gme to eachother artificially dropping the price over and over noone in this subreddit has the buying power to affect the markets like they have been affected price dropped to below 120 for a while now its steadily up over 200 as i speak but you need to bear in mind that melvin and his buddies are not finished considering the amount of money they have and how much stock price is going up and down and the fact that so many of us retail investors cannot actually buy any stock right now the door is open for melvin and his buddys to drive up the price of gme stock only for them to get it up to 250300 in the hopes that that will be high enough for many many of us to jump ship and sell gme if this happens and we do sell and inevitably melvin and co attempt to drop the price again this may allow them to drop the price enough to save themselves tomorrow when their 50 million shares will be shorted and theyll be at the mercy of the markets if we all hold until tomorrow we all win and the hedgefunds lose for once this is david vs goliath and they are going to try every trick in the book to encourage us all to sell sure hell look at the amount of bots that have infiltrated the subreddit and are desperately trying to encourage people to invest in other stocks they are doing all this in the hopes that the majority of us are out of the market before tomorrow so when the shorts are squeezed they dont lose billions and go bankrupt but fellow autists if we stay in it will be a historical day and we will have beaten wall st and we will all be alot richer because of it tldr stay strong and hold no matter what happens today and tomorrow we

1,3,2021-01-29 03:09:19,hedge fund tactics a summary of this weeks manipulation also posted to facebook to make sure as many people know about this as possible interesting to see the regulators and trading platforms step into action to silence retail traders and spread disinformation for doing exactly what hedge funds have been up to for years shorting a stock and market manipulation should be illegal across the board in case you are wondering how wallstreet has been manipulating the market this week please see the following monday media frenzy about how gme is a risky downgraded stock and how retailers dont know what they are doing mind you a newly appointed ceo who founded chewy has a very real chance of turning this company around hence the initial interest to begin with tuesday early morning coordinated sell off among investment bankers to try and scare retailers and trigger their stop losses to bring the price down so that they could close their short positions with profit wednesday fake article from cnbc suggesting that a key short seller hedge fund melvin covered all of his short positions to try and trigger retailers into thinking the short squeeze was over overwhelming evidence showed this was impossible and that he was still carrying those positions today robinhood other trading platforms shut off the ability for retailers to buy gme but allowed for the ability to sell this stock thus trying to bring the price down for investment bankers to get out of their short positions owing less money the very definition of market manipulation i cant wait for the movie to come out and hope this highlights how illegal it is for hedge funds to be allowed to short stocks at irresponsible levels for their own greed this has been fun to watch and alarming to see how far reaching wall streets power is capable of

1,46,2021-01-29 03:49:53,market manipulation what to do and pep talk this might be a long post but there is a lot of information floating around that i think needs to be compiled into one x200b about me i have been in this community since i started college a little over 2 years ago 21 now i have seen this group go from losing money on every trade making shitposts on literally thousands of dollars of loss and forcing robinhood to reassess their risk management three times to creating an army to take on the establishment although i dont like how large this subreddit has gotten this volume is necessary to maintain what weve accomplished so farthank you to the mods for how they have handled this growth you guys are the best and most organized team on this site by far this subreddit is my home im so proud to be included here even if my baby gains post from 2 years ago was removed and then the mod called me a retard lmao x200b market manipulation as many of us know and some are beginning to find out the big boys are participating in market manipulation who wouldve thought melvin and citadel have both attempted to crash gme by injecting billions in a number of ways these ways include but are not limited to in no specific order crashing the stock ah where the volume is low hoping for a lower open buying stop loss data in an attempt to create a snowball effect of sell orders buying out the media looking at you cnbc along with others to say that the squeeze has happened to say that we are the problem to say that we are the gamblers to say that we are the ones that need to be regulated tricking boomers into buying puts and now shutting down all buy trade for gme on the free and fair market this is disgusting even for me and i watch snuff film melvin themselves received a 25 billion dollar loan to cover their losses but instead of cover they decided to use that money to attack us this is a daybyday attack x200b where to buy gme get rid of robinhood for fucks sake if the constant server issues worthless customer service not knowing about leap years twice really robinhood and lack of account security wasnt enough to make you get out then maybe blatant stock market manipulation is enough oh we did that to protect our clients shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up no you fucking didnt i had robinhood because no other broker allowed me to open option positions blindly no other broker allowed me to bet on margin at 18 no other broker allowed me to bet on stock without experience robinhood doesnt give a fuck about you me or any of its users they care more about the people funding them robinhood is not the only one doing this but they are the most popular amongst the youth that are buying up gme interactive brokers and webull to my knowledge are others that stopped buy orders i have used fidelity for over a year now and they are perfect outages are rare customer service is great ever talk to someone from the midwest because i did when i called and they are in it for the user best part they are the largest institutional owner of gme need me to explain that to you they only profit if gme goes up they wont stop the buy orders from flooding in i doubt you can create an account and transfer your money over in one day but do what you can x200b where to report robinhood melvin capital citadel etc contact the house financial services committee they are a house of representatives committee dedicated to overviewing and regulating firms and banks call their number at 202 2254247 and leave a message to demand a hearing on the recent manipulation in the market thank you to ualphazed for bringing this to light contact your senators senator elizabeth warren and representative aoc your state senator is the first option because they are supposed to help you but elizabeth warren is the most prominent figure when it comes to the market she has fought for years for us and was one of the first adopters of consumer protections her contact info you can find on her website rep aoc is new but is perhaps the most competent person in the house to take these people on she is eloquent is one of us and doesnt back down to corporate her contact info is here contact the sec and file a complaint do not send multiple copypasted responses because they will be filtered as spam although the sec isnt on our side most of the time we can still make these complaints public and that will help with legislation and regulation along with the inevitable lawsuits you can contact them here class action lawsuit against robinhood anyone take to the streets of twitter and other platforms spread the word the more awareness we give this the bigger it will get i understand this is already international but most people dont understand whats going on they just know gme is going up for some reason explain this to your friends your parents strangers your dog etc get as much attention as possible x200b my positions and thoughts currently holding 71 shares avg $137 i lost $16k this morning in the span of 30 minutes i watched that motherfucker drop from $300 to $200 to lower than my average causing a total $1000 dollar loss that 16k loss was roughly 13 of my net worth did i sell hell fucking no this is no longer about the money i put $6k in originally at $18 and paper handed at $12 then bought $500 worth at $19 sold at $30 then bought more at $77 and sold at $96 because i wanted money i was just trying to ride the wave and couldnt handle the volatility as soon as i understood the gravity of the situation i went balls fucking deep and am holding until i die i love this stock this is not 1000 eow this is not 5000 eom this is not a sell this is a stand against the companies that took everything from us we are united as one we will bleed the rich we are not to be made fools anymore they cannot play with us they cannot toy with us we are taking them on headtohead multibillion dollar hedge funds against the fucking world we stand to lose nothing while they stand to lose everything we are not separate individuals anymore motherfuckers we are an entity and a force through the use of social media we love this stock there are now nearly 5 million of us 5 million we will not stand down we will not surrender im riding this motherfucker to $0 if i have to fuck the establishment fuck the hedge funds fuck the brokerage firms that betrayed us fuck the corporate shills lining their pockets with our money fuck the politicians that support this fuck the enablers that give excuse for this to happen they thought we wouldnt catch them they thought we wouldnt have the ability to take them on they were wrong im so fucking proud of you all hold until you die this is not about the money this is about the cause we are

417,80,2021-01-29 06:06:31,principles of democratic centralism applied to short squeezing hello fellow autists im mostly a lurker but i just wanted to clarify a few reasons why this $gme push was so successful and how it can be replicated for more success in the future x200b ultimately i believe this approach is repeatable and normally i wouldnt be so interested in making money but knowing who it is at the expense of has piqued my interest a bit more than usual x200b this can be a scientific method to expropriate wealth from the worst kinds of rich people and well i do like that very much indeed so i wanted to share my analysis of this success x200b 1 freedom of decision and debate the targeting of gme shorts was a collaborative effort from the rwsb mass line there was not a single centralized voice of authority that identified and mandated that $gme shorts should be targeted with a squeeze users smarter than me identified the weakness of the short positions and a consensus organically emerged among users as the information was processed x200b 2 unity of action if one consensus clearly emerges all members are expected to follow the party line and not deviate from the consensus or continue propagandizing against it instead they are committed to the decision made by a supermajority of other users the solidarity from subreddit users has been impressive hundreds of posts encouraging users to not sell and to buy more has forced the shorts into an irretrievable position they have no choice now but to lose everything despite coordinated efforts from their partners in the brokerages we won not because we had a perfect strategy or decisionmaking organization but because we were unified in our action this is the most important point we individuals have less money and thereby less market power than the hedge funds obviously the only way we are stronger than the funds is if we are committed to unity of action even if we werent the ones who were originally wanting to target gme shorts i wasnt involved until later in the game but even i bought in because i wanted to be part of something greater than myself of course not every single retail investor who bought gme made money but on the net the hedge fund lost billions that will be divvied up among the short squeezers x200b 3 general organization this was actually the weakest point in the chain and the greatest area that can be improved a subreddit with 300 new lowquality posts a minute is not quite the best way to arrive at a consensus i think better voting and discussion systems may be in order to improve this x200b this is me trying to take advantage of the political to make money this is not me trying to make a political post about which candidate you should support or which economic policy i want in my country its simply me talking about applying a method for better organizing the practice of buying stocks i like x200b the principle of democratic centralism which is a leninist idea is very applicable to organizing future short squeezes note that im not saying we should manipulate the market or try to drive prices up im just saying that if we all decide we like a stock we should buy it and if a lot of people are shorting a stock that can be a good reason to buy it 
288,36,2021-01-29 16:49:48,thank you to all of you every one of you retards for changing my life i just wanted to come here and say thank you to each and everyone of you i started buying gme at $12 when dfv jeff amazon started sharing their dds about gme holding it from then to now and given me life changing money im not a millionaire yet but i can actually help pay off some of my parents debt now if i walk away now but no im fucking doubling down and holding it for u muthafuckas i may be half way across the globe in asia but ill hold ill hold until i get my tendies and we will get u lads who bought at $450 positions 462 shares $28 avg 7 shares at 200avg all gme no diversification

383,100,2021-01-29 16:38:00,a suggestion for tomorrow that could genuinely flip the potential of the game x200b if this small piece of advice makes it to the front page and is followed properly it could literally shoot this thing to the moon the plan tldr when if the institutions manipulate the stock just like today and make it dip heavily what you need to do is time your buys close to the dip prices for example if it dips to 128 but calls at strike price 130 135 140 150 155 etc dated feb 5th you will have a halt and have time to buy and for maximum success people will buy at the halts on the way down and the halts on the way up this is because mms have to hedge and be market neutral by the end of the day which means if 2 k contracts go itm at strike price 130c after it rockets back up to say 250 then by the end of the day mms have to buy a of 2 000 100 shares per contract 200 000 shares to hedge and they all want to buy from a small float and all at the cheapest price which will set off the gamma squeeze it has to be close to the dip price because if mms and tutes find a way to supress the price tomorrow the call price has to be itm at eod last 20 min or else mms wont have to buy shares to hedge at all so the close to the dip price the better since gme shareholders dont have robinhood users buying shares and calls anymore to set off a catalyst for the gamma squeeze we need to make use of the dip and use it as a catapult to shoot us to mars there is no driving catalyst anymore people dont realize the stock will be a repeat of today unless they are outsmarted in ways so stupid they would never imagine it would be done i own gamestop shares this is just suggestions and speculation and i am not a financial advisor i made up all the numbers in this post i have no idea whats gonna happen tomorrow also im still pretty new but ive been retaining knowledge like a sponge so can any intelligent investors tell me whether im making any sense tldr for dummies when if it dips to the ground floor just like today buy infinite calls close to the stock price to give it fuel

804,227,2021-01-29 06:37:47,gme the infinity squeeze sources will be cited background on squeezes and infinity squeezes whats happening gme is ready for an infinity squeeze a short squeeze where over 100 of the float tradable shares are held short what is a short squeeze a short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted stock rises quickly and those who short the stock typically have to buy their shorted shares back to cover themselves this buying creates a huge spike in the price however this is nothing compared to an infinity squeeze there are two recorded infinity squeezes in history the more notable one was in 2008 and ran vw from 200 to 1000 in a day this was in 2008 during the financial crisis the average family did not have a broker and they were not trading they were worried about losing their house gme as of yesterday gamestop was still shorted over 122 there are rumors of that now being at 250 at least half of that must be covered tomorrow it says 2x days because friday options technically expire on saturday this means that over must be bought by tomorrow they will need to physically rotate through the shares buying the entire float selling and buying the other 22 of it the price will rise infinitely until enough sellers step forth and rotate their shares through this could bankrupt citadel and perhaps even citadels lenders the skyrocketing demand will send the price skyrocketing the average infinity squeeze moves a thousand percent in a day with options rising over 10000 percent whether or not you buy the price will skyrocket the banks need to buy back their own position buying the stock that they shorted at a huge loss its your opportunity to make money and laugh in the face of the rich
1251,383,2021-01-29 06:40:21,it doesnt matter who ends their restrictions on trades what matters is who never restricted them in the first place we need to list those appssites that never stopped trades and we need to list those that did regardless of their period of time these two lists need to be displayed prominently so everybody knows who stuck through it and who betrayed us sure webull¹ allows gme and nok trades now but they restricted before and they can easily do it again we cant forget that these companies will sell our their customers to appease their handlers maybe we cant trust any of these companies in fact definitely we cannot but today gives all these companies a track record that we need to hold them accountable for as best as we can edit ive gone ahead and started a list just a google doc if you would like to add anything or have any comments about it please place them on the doc itself so i can see them every company listed has just been pulled from this posts comments ¹webull was an example for illustrative purposes
251,43,2021-01-29 06:40:07,refer to the graphic describing volkswagens moass gme seems like last week when we were spreading that graphic around was a little too early now we have probably millions of clueless smoothbrains panic selling right into the funds hands can we agree to spread the graphic again the one which shows a huge dip right before the biggest part of the squeeze it would definitely help public sentiment in favor of gme and prevent all of the barstool idiots from selling after they all bought yesterday its important to reassure the masses when their positions dont go up 50 the first time

241,10,2021-01-29 14:36:42,robinhood small broker trading didnt make the volatility rise senate please take note that there was no robinhood buying today and the hedge funds managed to make gme continue to be the most volatile stock on the market with their shenanigans their actions have been predatory for far too long and when they locked robinhood traders traders using other smaller brokers out claiming protection for retail investors the volatility only got worse hedge funds and shorts were able to drive the price down to $120 by locking out willing buyers buyers who submitted hundreds of thousands of tickets to robinhood and other brokers explaining we like the stock the evidence is straight forward even with the blockade conducted gme rose in cnbcs words naturally to $300 with no robinhood buyers brokers and clearing companies are going to point fingers be on the right side of history everyone is going to be watching you hold all of the ceos of these scummy hedge funds and brokerages accountable they deserve to face criminal jail time for their actions away from their mansions and yatchs they were all complicit in forcing the price down and manipulating the market price of not just gme but many shorted companies and even some with less than 15 short interest bb they knowing took these actions because they dont believe the senate and law makers are going to do anything prove them wrong

235,120,2021-01-29 14:33:22,the next black swan reeeeeeetail crushes funds and causes a market selloff i will present some facts these facts are all kind of similar and arguably all say the same thing in different words this is a good thing because your smooth ass brain needs all the help it can get you should read all of this unless you cant read in which case just all in gme after i will present the logical conclusion and what you can do about it fact 1 hedge funds are getting reeeeeeeeeeamed by the rotation into memes see lots of big funds are longshort theyll look at all of the stocks in a sector like say retail or real estate and rank them from best to worst theyll go long the best one and go short the worst one you can probably already see where this is going the worst ones have gotten way too shorted and way too beaten up and now theyre being squeezed oh and the best stocks havent done much since august that means the gains dont come close to cancelling out the losses and god help the funds who are shortonly they are getting absolutely assblasted and you know theyre not enjoying it cause if they did theyd be hanging out here posting fat loss porn with us fact 2 shorts getting destroyed causes deleveraging and selling elsewhere in the market see and if theres one thing we know here at wsb its that youre a toilet paper handed bitch if youre not levered to the tits at all times the biggest funds know this too and being the biggest funds they have access to way more leverage than you and i do this is a bit of a problem for shorts though shorts need liquid capital to _close_ their positions if youve ever been in a situation where you sold a covered call or spread and got money for it and then immediately used that money to buy another call or something but then you wanted to buy your spread or your covered call back but couldnt close it because you just spent the money on something elsenow you know what is going on at these hedge funds they collected a bunch of money a long time ago when they shorted the stonk and then immediately spent all that money to juice their returns and now they need to have a fire sale just to have enough liquid capital to buy back their shit at a massive premium if you imagine the case of your typical longshort fund that means theyre being forced to sell their best stocks if you imagine a short fund that means theyre asking for bailouts and youre probably gonna find some of them behind wendys next week fact 3 the extreme volatility and volume in some stocks is causing a minor liquidity crisis see lets say youre broke but want to yolo on gme so you need to raise some money you go to a pawn shop and pawn them your graphics card for $1000 because they know they can go sell that fancy rtx3090 super duper titanium rgb hentai edition for more than $1000 on ebay if they need to well the next day imagine people start speculating on graphics cards and the prices go crazy some start selling for 10$ and some start selling for $5000 and every price in between if you try to pawn that graphics card tomorrow the pawn shop is gonna look at it and say hell no we have no idea how much we can sell that for were not gonna take that risk this is basically whats happening with loads of stocks right now ordinarily its not a big deal everyone knows how much a stock is worth right now and its extremely extremely likely it will be worth about the same price a few percent with 99 probability tomorrow and the day after and the day after so theyre happy to take it as collateral but right now some stocks are going up and down by 100 within minutes a stock could literally go from hundreds of dollars to next to worthless within a day or two so nobody is gonna take that as collateral if you own that for all intents and purposes you have zero dollars if you want to use your positions as leverage or if you were already using your positions as leverage this is a huge problem you need to find some different source of collateral if you cant you need to sell shit so that you have good ole usd its not just hedge funds that are feeling squeezed its the clearing firms and banks andbasically anyone that uses stonks as collateral for any purpose by the way this is what caused most of the selling back in march last year folks needed to raise money right now which meant selling all their shit right now which meant stonks went down which caused a cascade of margin calls and liquidations for folks that were levered to the tits fact 4 indices are at alltimehighs every sentiment indicator is at maximum euphoria but volatility is rising see any fucking chart as one of the greatest autists of our time once said be fearful when others are greedy everyone and their mother is levered to the tits why wouldnt you be the fed is handing out free loans to anyone with a pulse thats great cause it makes stonks go up really fast but if stonks start going down theyre also gonna go down really fucking fast too any selling will get further amplified by option gamma the same forces that are propelling gamestop in every direction simultaneously and the same forces that propelled the markets upwards particularly the big tech stonks after the march crash _________________________ conclusion we are set up perfectly for a deep violent correction if youre a hibernating starving for some porn i have just the thing for you this could turn into a fullon market crash if it really really gets going the more volatile the memes get the more volatile the market is going to get the more volatile the market gets the more selling has to happen the more selling the more volatility and boy does this escalate quickly for those of you budding autists and retards that were literally born yesterday just know that this feedback loop has happened many times before like this time almost a year ago however i would also like to note that this is 1000 divorced from the actual economy any dip will be violent and shortlived do not panic and btfd you smelly bundle of sticks theres a lot of dry powder on the sidelines that missed the dip in march and are still pissed about it such as yours truly who was too busy being a and they would love a chance to buy back into the market at a lowish price my recommendation do not be levered to the tits right now maybe toss a few dollars into way otm spy puts a few weeks out or longer as a hedge against your long positions do not go allin poots cause stonks only go up and wall street is actively working on ways to defuse this bomb but be ready for stonks to go down very quickly for a little while it can happen and if it does its gonna get ugly my positions allin gme except for a bunch of march spy puts im gonna buy tomorrow cause im a gambling degenerate not financial advice
261,75,2021-01-29 14:24:51,why it is in robinhoods best interest to lower the price of gme so i will simplify a bit on how a typical stock transaction works you have a platform you trade on robinhood webull td ameritrade etc you have a buyer and a seller you have a clearing house in the middle guaranteeing trades so lets start with explaining what a clearing house is in order to make certain that transactions run smoothly clearing corporations become the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer in other words they take the offsetting position with a client in every transaction for example if two investors agree to the terms of a financial transaction such as the purchase or sale of a corporate security a clearing corporation will act as a middle man facilitating the purchase on one end and the sale on the other end of the transaction via investopedia basically a clearing house just ensures that if person a sold stock to party b party a is able to get the funds right away instead of waiting for the settlement period the clearing house provides this service for a fee to the platform so that party a can get the funds right away while the clearing house will get theirs 2 days later from party b nbsp now lets bring up melvin capital into a scenario as an example melvin capital makes a highly leveraged trade by shorting over 100 in gme gme becomes viral and everybody opens a long position on gme rallying their stock price over 2000 melvin capital is in big trouble because they are highly leveraged and the trade is going against them and is at risk of defaulting clearing house is in big trouble because while they require some collateral to be pledged by its market participant it is a small percentage and if melvin defaults they are also in big danger because they cannot settle the funds for the other party smaller platforms often use a third party clearing house such as dtc but guess who robinhoods clearing firm is robinhood themselves source are you getting the picture here if melvin capital is at risk of bankruptcy and defaults on the payments owed robinhood is also majorly fed because they are in the hook for settling the users so one could argue that it is in their best interest to lower the price of gme so that melvin capital can get bailed out so that they themselves are not at risk of the default exposure nbsp just something to think about here and why there needs to be further investigation into todays action by robinhood to only let users close their positions sell on stocks like gme effectively crashing the price down tldr robinhood is a clearing broker so they are directly affected if melvin capital and other big hedge fund shorters default

206,209,2021-01-29 13:43:54,robinhood isnt malicious just cheap ripping this off from here x200b x200b essentially when you trade on robinhood they dont settle the trades for you they use whats called a clearing house which is where the actual exchange of money for shares happens trade settlement happens two days after you execute your trade t2 so robinhood has to keep money on account with the clearing house until the trades settle x200b x200b they have to keep a set amount thats defined by rule doddfrank so they dont really get a choice in the matter they also cant use your money which is client money it has to be their own capital the good news for them is they can net out their exposure so if you buy a stock but someone sells the trades net and its no exposure x200b x200b so what the fuck happened here today simple all week people have been dumping money in and buying more gme were all in this together so nobodys selling and some people are even buying more the bad news is because so many people are buying and the price of the stock keeps rising astronomically robinhoods margin requirements went way up youve probably seen the news that robinhood drew down their credit lines this week which basically means they had agreements with banks that if they needed to borrow money they could and they needed to this week so they did we literally bought so much of these stocks that robinhood couldnt afford to cover the requirements for you to buy more x200b x200b does this absolve robinhood fuck no they offer us a service and access to the market and they sell our order flow to hedge funds on the premise that they could provide us with that service they make tons of money the fact that they now couldnt afford to deliver on their service is their problem not ours they fucked up they werent ready to handle this and didnt see it coming even though it happened right in the open and right in front of them they made tons of money on our deal flow but somehow they didnt have enough to pay the margin requirements x200b x200b the good news is this means that they werent being malicious in trying to shut down buying note im not excusing them liquidating people out of positions thats a separate issue entirely just that theyre incompetent and inexcusably couldnt handle this volume of deal flow the bad news is the issue can absolutely happen again because this isnt fucking over and we arent done here the good news is with a day of no buy orders in there and trades settling every two days well be back to being able to buy sooner than later x200b x200b today was a blip and a mistake made by the professionals who run the infrastructure that serves the system the hedge funds got lucky and got a breather a quick day to get out from under the constant barrage weve put them under the day is over were coming back stronger and harder x200b x200b to prevent this from happening again open brokerage accounts with other brokers who dont have this problem spread the love pay a little more in fees and go get your bags lets fucking do this
332,50,2021-01-29 13:41:11,hedge funds everywhere hedge funds are basically foreign powers that have infiltrated every part of society both the public and private sectors they are incredibly damaging to us as a civilization obviously they control enough of the politicians government agencies like the sec and fed to shape the rules in their favor and screw over stock traders but just thinking this is as far as they go is wrong hedge funds influence of the private sector is ever more damaging by controlling media outlets they can shape private opinions how many of those analysts think a company really doesnt have as much value just to have their company sell puts on it the next week or try to bankrupt the company through massive profitable short selling ivy league universities have steadily shifted their billions of endowment from stocks to hedge funds over the past few decades they are almost completely invested in hedge funds now it is absolutely disgusting the game these universities play with each other a competition who can get the highest donations to impress protentional students on college tours but who will never benefit from the donated money because it is corruptly wrapped up in hedge funds by administrators who lie that it somehow benefits society to invest in hedge funds rather than research by insanely smart scientists standing 10 feet away from them hedge funds destroy regular peoples jobs and hire math phds computer scientists and machine learning engineers to work on problems but these problems dont serve humanity in any positive way they waste the skills of some of the most talented people on the planet with the lure of money even though they are making slave wages compared to the ceo imagine a world where regular people continue to be able to work their regular job contribute and we as a civilization become more advanced by research being spent on things that help humanity instead of this pointless game of algorithmic trading calculating if they can still profit if they get sued and destroying companies for profit its like how the kings in the dark ages could have lived far better lives if they spent their gold on trying to understand thing build things like mills but instead they spent their gold on living lavish lifestyles until they died im glad they are all dead we still live in the dark ages of dangerous greedy kings willing to fuck over anyone to live a more lavish lifestyle but now we can fight back make them less powerful gonna put my whole account in gme if robinhood lets me at 120 short float we have the ability to bankrupt multiple hedge funds and vastly improve society gotta spend money to make money

778,191,2021-01-29 12:48:45,high gme valuation explination the price is justified we are not a short targeting group we like the stock i am tired of hearing this on the media and even aocs twitch stream is parroting this melvin is just in the wrong place at the wrong time dd below x200b gme is a gaming company that got a ceo and board members who are experts in ecommerce and know how to succeed in an industry dominated by amazon this same ceo and these same board members created chewy which is a successful and growing $42b market cap company and it is not unreasonable to expect this same group could provide similar returns for gme too gmes current market cap is only $13b even at its current closing price price this means there is a long way to go about 4x more to be specific x200b moreover ark invest thinks gaming and specifically vr will grow massively in the next five years ark details this explicitly in their 2021 research report which you can read here it starts on page 21 a virtual world is defined as a computersimulated environment that can be accessed by anyone at any time society interacts daily with virtual worlds which today are in their infancy according to our research revenue from virtual worlds will compound 17 annually from roughly $180billion today to $390billion by 2025 x200b it therefore makes perfect sense to assume gme now with a new ceo who is an expert in ecommerce will position gme to take advantage of a potentially $390b industry therefore it is not unreasonable to assume gme may be worth more than chewy in the near future given this potential market growth finally modern gaming requires a tremendous amount of computational power meaning we should expect gme to sell this expensive and high margin hardware as well as accessories along with their gaming consoles and games lets put this all together if gme grows to the size of chewy and becomes a $42 billion dollar company their share price should be about $623 and depending on how they position themselves to take advanatge of the vr market they could potentially see far more upside in the near future gme is well positioned to do so because they own brick and mortar stores around the country that will act as distribution centers meaning they already have an upper hand on their competitors x200b we like this stock x200b important updates and information i missed from umrlancaster bro you forgot about the cut they get from microsofts gamepass subscription service its a great value for bot xbox gamers bit pc gamers which like you mentiond gamestop will be selling hardware for i also heard about building them in store not sure x200b from ubvdubs to supplement this dd we also have the potential of exclusive andor earlyaccess partnerships with key players in every space ryan cohen reggie filsaime the former coo of nintendo of america and elon musk the sea shanty meme lord of tesla himself are individuals that have the potential of changing the game entirely we believe in the value in the future we believe in the stock
446,42,2021-01-29 12:46:58,open letter to the american people overleveraged hedge funds wasnt sure were to post this but everyday americans deserve to know what these hedge funds have been doing politics are still for retards there has been a significant degree of media attention regarding gamestop and the broader stock market this week this is the real story on the issue from someone intricately involved over the last year i have no fear to tell the entire country what happened behind closed doors every side of the aisle in washington and every office on wall street is responsible and the american people deserve to know because they have been continually robbed over the last decade your retirement account your childrens college fund and the mortgage of your own home the manner in which hedge funds operate poses extreme risk to the economy and in some cases illegal gamestop is just a symptom of the problem and will not be fixed by the people you tasked to do so i am a 20 year old college student paying for school working two jobs saving people and shoveling gravel i am also a member of wallstreetbets and have actively traded for several years i have nothing to gain and nothing to lose but believe what has been occurring is not tolerable and arguably against the law this narrative being pushed by the media is incorrect either by design or ignorance neither is acceptable to start i have no confidence in the governments ability and willingness to address the factors which have allowed us equity markets to completely detach from real economic activity the very congressman and regulators which are tasked to maintain an efficient free market are inextricably part of the establishment that benefits from gamifying said markets almost every congress member is a multimillionaire and maintains their wealth through the asset market multiple congressional members have their wealth parked in the very hedge funds at fault the regulators later serve as board members at these brokers and funds immediately after their tenure the people tasked with addressing this problem have no incentive to fix the underlying issues and will place the blame with everyday people who found a fault and capitalized what happened with gamestop is the culmination of how our markets have been run since the 2008 financial crisis banks were deleveraged and forced to change their operation after wiping out entire generations of wealth for average middle class americans in the decade since this risk this leverage was only moved off book to private hedge funds which operate in a dark corner of the market these players operated at 10 12 15 x leverage turning a few billion dollars of wealthy clients money into trillion dollars of notional exposure they utilize this leverage to seek an edge on the market alpha and multiply clients capital while taking a chunk for themselves their 2 and 20 this demands they outperform the market on a consistent basis to reap gross returns in the artificially low volatility environment created by the fed and treasury for the last decade massive degrees of leverage works these exclusive funds created massive wealth for their wealthy clients by frontrunning retail trades exploiting passive holdings and using infinite leverage to manipulate prices fund managers are the ones buying paintings and sports teams however to keep these returns and fees going they need to continually seek alpha for this very reason melvin capital and other hedge funds knowingly created an explosive situation in us capital markets with disregard for economic efficiency under zero accountability and access to such high leverage gabe plotkin and other fund managers shorted gamestop and other companies into the ground aiming for a bankruptcy the stock was pummeled down 90 over a few years to just $257 instead of taking their profits these funds doubled down because they need to keep returning capital they leveraged up and engaged in extremely reckless and illegal naked short selling to drive this company into bankruptcy when financials did not warrant so wallstreetbets is barely relevant yes we were the first to look but anyone could have found the mistake gabe plotkin and co made with a few google searches the fact that media like cnbc painted such a negative picture while having a conflict of interest eliminates any facade of integrity when real people make devastating financial mistakes they lose everything no one is there to provide a backstop reality is harsh through our continuous bailouts and lack of disclosure these funds face no consequences the us taxpayer bankrolled their overleveraged losses during the initial pandemic crash while being denied the help of their own money the entirety of congress was complicit massive amounts of taxpayer money and federal reserve capital was used to backstop the losses they had incurred without addressing the dangerous leverage money that taxpayers in financial peril deserved after being put in crisis through no fault of their own this money was spent so these managers could keep their miami beach mansions without selling their sports team while real people decided whether to spend their $1200 on food or rent these people have never had to see the consequences of their decisions because they can change the rules when need be all the characters involved in this one instance have been implicated in illegal activity fraud in the magnitude of billions of dollars and are allowed to continue after paying paltry fines steve cohen gabe plotkin and citadel securities among others need to be fully investigated in a transparent manner the stock market cannot act correctly until systematic changes are made the way hedge funds have operated for the last decade is not sustainable and is detrimental to economic efficiency with such large buying power they can short companies into bankruptcy regardless of the fundamentals against all principles of free market capitalism positions and leverage of these funds are not disclosed in full and only quarterly through 13fs no short selling is ever disclosed and therefore the true risk profiles these funds are taking is unknown that unknown risk has blown up multiple times but nothing has been done they operate in a very dark corner of the market and are able to circumvent the even playing field of an open market their excessive leveraging causes outsized volatility and poses the risk of extreme losses i do not believe that the us government is capable of executing justice but the american people deserve to know what is truly going on you are being robbed of your livelihood your prosperity and your future demand those at fault for crisis time and time again finally see the consequences of their actions be mad tldr sir this is a wendys r fuk gme 69420c 129

626,197,2021-01-29 11:57:14,they will double down on their tricks tomorrowpay attention i would not be in the slightest surprised if robinhood planned outages or server problems for tomorrowin case we go up again limited buying might open the gates for manipulating activity you have to understand that in todays downturn there was probably not a single share available for the funds to buy some even reported here that their sell limit was executed at prices above 2000$ so citadel and the mm will try to increase their coordinated attacks to a certain extent tomorrow i encourage you to read the dd posted by uveryslump as an infinite gammashortepic squeeze may be looming be careful if you can to brokers who didnt fold to the pressure today such as fidelity i heard that setting it up is pretty quick and easy consider sofi vanguard schwab and td too further info in the comments is welcome inform yourself on their respective websites if necessary if you do switch make sure to do it only if you have cash available because they will freeze your positions if you take them to another broker if you have open positions on robinhoodjust hold the line never buy on margin we saw what robinhood did today executing orders without consent keep cool and stay calmthey are starting to fear the implications of their own conducts and most importantly disclaimer 4 gme 212$174 i am not a financial advisor
138,55,2021-01-29 11:39:06,webull ceo we needed to limit buying due to closing house mechanics link to interview ceo of webull in the above interview stated that the cost of clearing each share during settlement has increased 200300 since last week and brokerages are struggling to fund it or at least allocate money to the clearing house while they wait for the shares to clear edit not the cost per se but the escrowamount if you watch he misunderstands the question about the role disabling buying played in the fierce downward action around the open in the gme market today but his claims seem to have some merit and explain why both webull and rh tapped their credit lines today and now are reenabling share purchases this is above my paygrade but well see if one of you knows anything about it my lone ex hedgefund friend said it is a reasonable explanation of course you would think rh ceos could manage to spit this out as well unless they dont understand themselves numbers too big slow down numbers and get loans
2153,247,2021-01-29 11:28:43,why i paper handed gme why im buying back in and why i think all s should follow suit this is not financial advice i hope this wont get deleted and this becomes somewhat of a beacon to all s i was in gme since november i first bought in around $16 i even when we experienced the post earnings drop to $12 and double down to decrease my cost basis i believed in the thesis i had conviction but as soon as we jumped to the 30s i started to slowly liquidated and take some off the table i did this all the way up until my last share at around $250 i was extremely happy for my gains i turned 4k into 20k more money then i ever had in my brokerage but i sold because i was worried see the thing is i am going through the process of quiting my job i was a correctional officer and working conditions have deteriorated beyond anything acceptable i was going to take my retirement and use it to thetagang to support my family and myself while i try to grow my candle business i have a mortgage a wife her boyfriend and their 2 beautiful children i need to take care of and the 20k i made would be extremely helpful in making sure we can make this work i was gonna take my gains and run but something changed that something happened today see i always loved the idea of sticking it to the man via gme but it didnt really hit me how important this was until today they fought back today and they did it through playing unfair this is no longer about the gains this is no longer about my family this is bigger than us this is about class disparity the wealthy versus the poor or the common manwoman tomorrow im going back in and i dont care if it goes to 0 and i lose my money there comes moments in life where you have to go beyond your own self interest but to benefit the collective and fight for the cause this is the retarded form of jumping onto a grenade to save others but this could still have the potential of making you filthy rich i hope all s who hopped out decide to hop back in with this is mind dont even think about the tendies think about whats right edit much love and thanks for everyone who is supportive and willing to go back in i just wanted to say this so people realize how powerful this movement is i had a fellow autist reach out to me who was underage and cant buy any shares because of that heshe literally offered to send me money to buy on their behalf understand how powerful this truly is ps im not taking the kids money but i did say ill buy himher a share and if it squeezes ill send himher the profit
1390,101,2021-01-29 11:28:23,the most important lesson i learned from udeepfuckingvalue udeepfuckingvalue is the smartest autist we all love we watched as he bet it all on gme and went from $113k in sept 2019 to $42k in jan of 2020 in march 2020 when the rest of the market died udeepfuckingvalue finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel and was upto $298k but this is where many missed his true genius his play started to pay off and he moved $103k to cash over the next several months he used that cash position to keep up his gme play dropping back down as low as 26k cash and a total account value of $113k again in july 2020 i dont know how he stomached putting that 103k cash back into gme but it paid off by the end of august 2020 things really got interesting he is down to 8k cash but his account has rocketed to 600k value 3 weeks later his account hits 15m and he has moved $250k to cash double his initial investment and from what we see has kept that cash since november 2020 he is upto $3million account value and $11m in cash hes done it hes a millionaire and set for life but he doesnt stop there he hold his cash but keeps strong on his gme positions january 2021 now things get crazy gme explodes in the best possible way by january 22 his account hits 7m and he has 25m in cash 3 days later $11m and nearly $5m in cash january 27 2021 $47m and 13m in cash dfv secured 13m in gains on his gme positions and the story isnt over januray 28th he dropped back down to $33m thanks to the manipulation and collusion by brokers and hedge funds but he still has that 13m in cash secured we will see where he goes from here but i hope he keeps that $13m in cashand eventually invests most of it in a diversified portfolio and lives the financially independent luxury lifestyle he has earned x200b in case you missed it the lesson here is to secure profits along the way if we all get rich on the journey then it doesnt matter what happens after we cross the finish line dfv is a legend and we all thank you for sharing your story and insights with us x200b edit fixed a date

159,97,2021-01-29 10:44:11,lets talk about the endgame in a previous post i discussed the prisoners dilemma that both longs and shorts find themselves in link to previous post heres the situation we find ourselves in if we simply refuse to sell our shares we force a transfer of wealth from anyone holding even a single share short what we have revealed is a completely broken market mechanic where it is possible to have short interest over 100 of the float this should be completely illegal mathematically and theoretically speaking if all longs band together and refused to sell the valuation of gamestop would be as follows the sum of the net worths of anybody who holds even one single gme share short so what is the end game here other hedge funds have spotted this game and joined in with us its not going away it doesnt matter if retail is blocked out at this point the end game is the government will have to step in and suspend gme force shorts to liquidate until si is below 100 and then resume trading with a ban on having si go above 100 best part the squeeze is still on after this the equilibrium state of this game is 50 si thoughts fellow autists

480,175,2021-01-29 09:15:09,wall street still has at least one bullet left tldr at the end today showed what many of us already know the billionaires the market makers the people running the game are absolute cowards who cant handle losing when we lose money its fine but when they lose money they are allowed to unplug our controller and use some cheat codes to get themselves closer to being back in the green ive seen a number of people suggesting that this is it theyre out of ammo but i dont think thats true i suspect tomorrow is going to be even more blatant even more obvious even more open in how they manipulate the market i think tomorrow they turn off the console and rip the cord out of the wall i think we will see similar manipulation to what we saw today when the price crashed from $500 to just over $100 in a matter of less than an hour i think we will see strong sell offs to get the share price under a certain target perhaps $100 and then we will see a full day trading halt for the stock stocks can be halted by exchanges when market manipulation is occurring or suspected to have occurred the fact that its the big players doing the manipulating doesnt matter in theory the stock could still be halted for any amount of time until the exchange is satisfied why would they do this if they can move call options from itm to otm they dont need to buy those shares this will help further suppress the share price as well as fucking anyone who was holding those calls one quick caveat its possible the backlash today from politicians celebs and the average joe might make them think twice its becoming clear that at the very least these bastards are going to be put under a microscope for what happened today they may not want to risk it again tomorrow additionally for this to happen i think theyd need to get the actual stock exchange on board which might be harder to do than some brokerages on the other hand they are going on tv and laughing about doing illegal things so maybe they will tldr diamond hand this bitch harder tomorrow than ever before if you think wall street has thrown in the towel youre dead wrong i think were going to see more red than we have this week if youre holding calls that are just barely itm i wish you luck positions none in gme will be liquidating some nongme positions tomorrow to buy shares disclaimer this is not investment advice its just my opinion on what might happen im very clearly retarded and have no idea what the hell im talking about maybe this is satire
658,262,2021-01-29 09:12:16,did you lose gme money today read this so a lot of us lost money today ive seen a fair few posts about how much money has been lost and quite honestly im among you in the pain when you feel like you regret not taking money off the table but we move on what matters is the sentiment and power behind the force that sent this stock to $350 $500 in the first place assuming that youve been in gme since $100 you are still in profit by a considerable amount and you still have more buying power than you did when we first started some of you havent sold a single share and that takes some serious guts to hold on considering the day we have had with multiple swings from $190 to $490 up and down all day the only thing standing between successfully squeezing the shorts is the ability for new investors to buy the ones who are currently holding and refuse to sell are doing all they can to make sure that we do our part to continue the fight tldr you likely have more buying power than when you first entered your position and just because you lost money today doesnt mean this over hold strong 
104,26,2021-01-29 09:04:08,i like the stonk some dddd and some motivation first to get you in the mood for my retarded math i just posted this as a comment regarding the brokerage blockages today but thought it was good enough for a post as itll likely get buried in comments its funny i guess often moves like this work out the same way but i am starting to thing of the robinhood move as a hidden blessing if we did not already have peoples attention we sure as fuck do ive noticed that most people felt it was fine watching a bunch of retards throw themselves and their life savings against the wall of corruption that is wall street hey look what these fucking smooth brained morons are doing haha yea fuck wall street but then they had a chance to see just how dirty wall street is willing to play this isnt an episode of fucking suits this is real fucking life yet the plot is juicier than anything that suits came up with now people are sayin hold on their just a bunch of retards trying to take the penny off the bottom of your shoe why you have to hold their hands back while you kick them in the nuts these same people and now standing up for that injustice how are they doing it they are buying gamestock i bought an extra 25 shares today that i had not planned on buying i know several other friends and family who bought 1 2 or 10 shares because they saw the stonk and they liked the stonk because stonks go up and $gme is a great stonk with the weight of the world behind us we will break this fucking wall we will defeat wall street and we will watch papa elon launch a fucking rocket into space with the gamestop logo on it when $gme hits $42069000 hooorah ya fucking retards lets get them gme to the moon now for the math please keep in mind that i am not a financial analyst not even close i am a smoothbrained autistic retard and this is my first time ever getting actually deep into a trade i actually just fully made up this math and hope that its correct my brain is so smooth that numbers actually generally make sense and i feel the numbers hold up data is from the options buying page on my brokerage virtual brokers i beleive the delta values to be up to date assuming those move with the market but i am not sure about open interest as those are not updated daily i took the data from my brokerage and put it into excel i thought up a simple euqation to try and calculate how much is short right now that equation is show in the image below hope the embed works and is as follows 1delta if delta is 1 then it is 100 covered x open interest calls outstanding x 100 shares per contract x current price strike x200b blockquote classimgurembedpub langen dataidafcwpeze datacontextfalse a hrefimgurcomafcwpezeimgurcomafcwpezeablockquotescript async srcsimgurcomminembedjssimgurcomminembedjs charsetutf8script link in case embed does not work this calculation shows us something neat if we sit at $500 a share it will be just under $500 million worth of delta short to cover and about 2000000 in shares to buy to cover the execution of itm options x200b at $350 a share it is $195 million and 1858 million shares to cover

406,212,2021-01-29 08:44:07,the numbers behind a possible squeeze tomorrow not even counting that gamestop is currently at $261 in the aftermarket at the closing price of $19360 there are roughly 40000 call contracts expiring in the money tomorrow anyone currently holding those contracts will execute tomorrow which translates to shorts having to buy 4 million shares of gamestop on friday gamestop only has a total of 46 million shares available to trade and a large percentage of that is being held by us retail investors and other entities idk how many shares exactly maybe someone could help on that this translates to a relatively large percentage of the tradeable shares having to be bought tomorrow and the potential start of a short squeeze x200b bottom line as long as the price of gme stays above $193 tomorrow shorts will have to buy 4 million shares of gme the only thing that could prevent this is manipulation x200b tldr if the current price holds lots of buying will have to happen on friday no matter what this could trigger a potential squeeze starting tomorrow x200b x200b all numbers pulled from x200b dont sue me i am not a financial advisor trade at your own risk and do your own research x200b

393,64,2021-01-29 08:33:36,if youve been on sub for a while now and have been around long enough to have followed the gme play from the very start take a moment and marvel at what this has turned into its no longer just a hilariously risky yolo limited to a handful of idiots here and over on stocktwits but a showdown between retail and institutionals that has taken global center stage i remember first hearing mentions of gmes short interest back in march of last year but like everyone else i was too preoccupied with spy options msft 200c and the infamous quadwitching fiasco wonder how many people were wiped out that day only in july did i really begin paying serious attention to the gme talk but never did i imagine that this would culminate in a historic moment led by a sub full of foulmouthed gambling addicts weve really outdone ourselves here rstocks rdividends and rinvesting may be better at portfolio sizing and actually knowing what risk management is but theyre nowhere nearly as wonderful edit obligatory gme 
176,49,2021-01-29 08:32:01,cnbc is reporting that robin hood is seeking lines of credit from jpm and goldman sachs turn on the tv i dont really know what this means other than if they have an algorithm that takes positions against their customers they could in theory be blown up by gme i know that they are able to get fractional payoffs from timing trades im not really sure if we know their positions or we have a way of finding it out im not involved in gme because of the lock out but this seems really serious if they were betting against their clients wouldnt this be illegal as they do have a fiduciary responsibility when offering their products online feel free to call me stupid my wifes boyfriend does all the time i cant find an article on it but this has happened before in march2020 so maybe its not editrelated to yesterdays fall out i guess this is pure speculation
2222,365,2021-01-29 08:22:37,warning possible strategy the hedge funds are doing to recover from losses as you guys have already heard from several reports citadel the hedgefund that bailed out melvin capital for 25 billion dollars and robinhood have ties with each other what they did this morning was they planned for robinhood and other brokers to prevent retail investors from buying gme and other reddit memestocks knowing that would kill a lot of momentum before disabling the buy button for gme on platforms like robinhood they heavily shorted the stock when it was at its peak of around 500 and when the stock came crashing down back into the 100s that was when they bought back the shares and earned back some of the losses right as the market closed at 4 they released the news that starting tomorrow retail investors will be allowed to buy gme and other memestocks again therefore causing the prices of these stocks to go up again as momentum comes back and the prices surge to higher levels again im willing to bet my left nut that they will short it again and then do some unethical shady shit to kill the momentum again to recover further from their previous losses what shady shit might they do i do not know but its going to be something on the level of what happened today they will keep on rinsing and repeating this strategy till they make back most of their losses now what can we retards do to counteract their strategy you may ask simple when the momentum killer news comes out again you hold and do not panic sell otherwise you will be selling your shares cheap to them for them to cover their short positions i am not a financial advisor but that is how i see it logically speaking
143,10,2021-01-29 08:10:34,remember to gather and keep any and all evidence of market manipulation now that many brokers seem to have tried to manipulate the market the idea of class action lawsuits has arisen here if one of your brokers tried to manipulate the market or so you think make sure to use screenshots and the like to gather evidence you might think that testimony or someone elses screenshots will be enough but more evidence can make a case like this easier so remember to find the evidence and store it there are people creating meeting places to discuss the lawsuit and gather evidence dont send it all to me i wouldnt know what to do with it and friendly reminder this game is not over gme has to more than double in value before the end so hold boys and girls disclaimer i am not a legal or financial expert this is all just my speculation estimation andor opinion
785,176,2021-01-29 08:07:02,to the people who are scared of missing the gme squeeze you will know when it happens aka gme endgame a lot of comments that i read people are scared that they will miss the gme squeeze let me tell you about the volkswagen squeeze that happened in 2008 on 28th oct 2008 volkswagen stock opened at 500 euros the stock hit an ath of 1005 euros during the day and closed at 945 euros this means that you will certainly know when the squeeze begins now the question is how high can the squeeze go that no one here knows for sure because the times have changed and it can easily reach maybe 2k$ or 5k$ who knows you can sell the stock at the squeeze when the price massively goes up at the price you are comfortable with when the squeeze happens do not worry the squeeze will not last for like 5 or 10 seconds as we saw with the example from volkswagen above which lasted a whole day also many people are thinking to sell on friday or monday do not sell unless there is a squeeze or do not lose hope if the stock does not moon on monday opening it will come and it will be beautiful alas if udeepfuckingvalue held the stock for months and is waiting for the squeeze then who are we paper handed people to sell early diamond hands only cheers information on the volkswagen article x200b ps this is not financial advice i am holding gme because i like gamestop and i like games
227,44,2021-01-29 08:02:20,robinhood $gme call options shenanigans anyone else tldr robinhoods inconsistent arbitrary and capricious changing of policies and unilateral actions on my account turned a very small profitable options bet on $gme which should have paid out a couple $k into a $15k loss all completely without my knowledge consent or action on my part note i am an experienced options trader 15 years have worked at a hedge fund have worked at the worlds largest private equity firm and now work in venture capital you savants are as legit as most of these hedge fund jebronies any day of the week obligatory currently holding 400 $gme shares will buy 20 more asap obviously bought in starting at $35 and still buying more mostly holding shares in schwab now bc fk rh hold the line anyway ive experienced some serious shenanigans from robinhood today that i think goes beyond just their no trading $gme lunacy want to see if anyone else got screwed in a similar way and discuss how to get robinhood to fix this back when $gme was at $35 i made a small bet on gme by purchasing 129 $49 $50 long call spreads this means that i bought $49 calls and sold $50 calls all on one trade ticket as a spread if the stock were to close above $50 at expiration or exercise i should net the difference of $100 per spread this trade cost me a measly $15 per spread which should have been the maximum possible loss i poured most of my $ into buying shares obviously but i couldnt resist placing a couple small options trades just for fun because of robinhoods arbitrary policy changes this small options trade which was deeply in the money was transformed into a massive loss heres how at like 4am today robinhood assigned my short call options meaning it forced my account to sell 100s of gamestop shares at $50share this would normally be a welcome event given my call spread was deeply in the money i should have been able to exercise my long call options to simultaneously buy 100 shares per contract at $49share on most brokerage platforms this would happen automatically immediately netting the difference as a realized gain so a $100 gain per contract i of course tried to immediate exercise my $49 calls instead robinhood had removed my ability to exercise my $49 call options presumably due to it restricting all buying of the stock so in essence it forced me to sell shares at $50 but refused me my right to buy shares at $49 this would already be a problem but then it got much worse after to the forced sale of shares at $50 due to option assignment and inability to exercise my $49 options my account ended up with a net short position in $gme in no world did i want to be short $gme then without my knowledge or consent robinhood automatically sold other securities in my account and used the proceeds to buyback $gme stock to close out the short position furthermore their automatic buy which again i was not notified of nor did i consent to placed a limit buy order at $426share at market open which was $161share higher than the stocks opening price naturally the trade executed right away and instead of executing at the then current market price it bought 100s of shares at $426 each again this is instead of automatically exercising or allowing me to exercise the call option i already held in my account giving me the right to purchase shares at $49 finally like many others i was not able to purchase the stock when i wanted to today i had limit buy orders at $200 outstanding wtf there is no reason why call spread purchased for $15 and in the money at anything gt$50share should have resulted in a $15k loss as a sophisticated investor who understands the math and the contractual rights and obligations of options contracts it is absolutely unconscionable and should be impossible what robinhood unilaterally and arbitrarily did in my account recap rh autoforced my acct to sell 100s of shares to someone at $50 and then forced me to buy them back at $426 ending up with 0 $gme shares all while i had plenty of call options to cover this and not letting me execute conclusion rh super shady buying $gme with everything ive got in schwab edit thanks for the flair and great call ukstorm88 youre right this pretty much nails it

0,277,2021-01-29 15:32:56,gme rational consideration from a professional investor i know it feels like you guys have discovered a cheat code with option gamma squeeze and short squeezes for those who got in at $50share and made 1050x on options congratulations i am not saying the populist anger isnt justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didnt fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float but sometimes its good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in european when draghi announced ltro there are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis the more the price of gme rises the likelihood that the sec will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases but vegaseller you say we will just hold and when it resumes our infinite money wormhole will work again time is on our side the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding the problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between gme management and a short seller consortium it is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium although much lower than the current market price management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20100 sharesshare a considerably discount to the current share price their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price and the higher the runup in gme share price the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range once a deal is largely settled they will loop the sec in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock if this happens you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10$50 there is no shame in taking some money out just here to point out how the shorts can still get out at a much lower cost than you think again its just food for thought make your own judgement
31,3,2021-01-29 15:30:22,i hate the argument that wsb will create some poor bagholders with the gme play can i just say how much i fucking hate how some interviews particularly the cnbc interview with chamath seem to focus on how what these redditors are doing is just going to leave these poor bagholders who thought gme could reach $15000 and make them rich but lost everything when the stock finally goes back to normal oh im sorry did i hear any fucking violins when these hedge funds tried to force gme to go bankrupt which would inevitably cause a ton of people to lose their jobs and lose their rsus im sure some employees had stock compensation not only that but these hedge funds were doing it without any transparency on purpose it wasnt just a few shorts here and there betting that maybe the stock was overvalued no this was a short of 100 of the available shares on the market which is supposed to be illegal a short so massively leveraged so as to sway momentum in their direction because who would bet so much money if they were wrong they werent making just a simple bet they were betting the horse would lose the race whilst sneaking poison into the horses food reddit and everyone here is being fully transparent about what the gme play is and means this is a short squeeze of epic proportions this is a middle finger to those fuckers like steve cohen who always manage to break the law to make themselves rich without getting in trouble no one here is saying gme will guarantee your retirement does a casino pull a person betting too wildly aside and say hey you should probably stop youre losing more money than you can afford to lose do we have laws that protect those poor fucks who get shaken at casinos but cant stop because theyre addicted yet here we have a play that anyone jumping into can easily research what the risks are and why they are jumping in before jumping and suddenly we are worried about some made up scenario where a poor kid who tried to follow wsb lost his savings with gme if you dont want the stock market to be a casino then ban options for everyone no more side bets just buying stock like a boomer if thats all the governmentinstitutions want the solution is right in front of them no one here denies that once the shorts get fucking fleeced and the positions close this big fuck you is over i dont know anyone buying gme shares without knowing why now thats not to say that this scenario might not happen i very well hope it doesnt but if some poor kid loses everything on the gme squeeze it was not because of wsb it was because of the bullshit these hedge funds can pull no stock should ever be this volatile unless you build a system that allows it to happen if fucking melvin capital got margin called when they should have at like $20 this whole thing would be over and things would stabilize at what a normal person would say is a reasonable price based on fundamentals but this is beyond fundamentals this is about sending a strong message that if hedge funds can make these fucking absurd manipulative bets then average investors should be allowed to make the opposite bet and if they win they did so legally and transparently no one forced anyones hand at any time no one is operating in the shadows like those fuckers do anyway im not even in gme because im a pussy and grew up with the boomer stock mindset but ive been growing ive been a longtime lurker here this place always provides me with a mix of fun knowledge and a ton of laughter but i just want to say thank you on behalf of all the normies busting their ass to make money the way this country claims your supposed to despite the fact that wealth inequality continues to spiral out of control because people who play with stocks have entirely different rules and their gains compound while cash salaries simply move with inflation at best ive read too many books like liars poker billion dollar whale and dark edge to have anything but contempt for these hedge fund fuckheads this entire story is giving the world the education those books give without forcing people to read its fucking genius and the best way to educate a huge population in a short amount of time mad respect out
522,111,2021-01-29 15:10:38,if you have an itm call tomorrow and can afford it dont sell and exercise if you sell it those hedge funds can get out of their positions at a fixed price but if you execute theyll have to scramble to find shares to cover and without any stocks afloat theyre fucked and will have to pay whatever anyone asks for a share and they get fucked theyve written too many call options for amt of shares available and if everybody exercises instead of selling all these guys will get royally screwed also exercise and buy because you like the stock positions 69 shares of gme 
245,92,2021-01-29 15:58:21,please be careful there seems to be a misconception that the short interest ratio is frequently updated gme hello smooth brains ive been reading lots of posts lately and there seems to be a misconception that we will know when the short squeeze happens based on the short interest ratio but the sir is only updated bimonthly you can read as much here the latest we have available is only up to the 15th and was reported on wednesday and is 120123 of float at this point we dont know what it actually is anymore unless someone knows something i dont i think it is important to realize that the only statistic that you can infer from would by short shares availability from a site like this which interestingly enough hasnt been updated all day this thursday because they werent given any data hmm just thought id make a post to keep everyone informed and trade safely there isnt going to be a big crayon arrows on the ground telling you what to do anyways you degenerates wipe the drool off your chin and hold gme 
276,56,2021-01-29 15:56:26,psa if you are holding gme calls that you plan to exercise exercise them before closing weve seen how influential melvin and the hedge funds are when it comes to changing the price of gamestop and they know how influential they are they know that at 400 edt all open options will exercise this makes it an obvious play for the suits to try to push the stock price down before closing to make as many calls as possible worthless if you exercise when youre at a very solid gain this will help protect you as well as help people with higher strike prices make their break even point which will cause for even more gains remember gme is early in its rise and will break the edge of the universe if melvin amp friends get successfully squoze like a grape also remember to buy like you have no concept of money and well all become gmellionaires before you can say crispy hundo aint never gonna buy gamestop also pt2 someone pointed out the possibility that melvin may have had the audacity to sell us naked calls if we exercise our calls theres a very good chance that we can force them to put up more money if you dont have the money to cover your incredibly profitable call then you better deposit the funds before your broker pulls a margin call and fucks you over exercise contracts do it all throughout the day and 
168,29,2021-01-29 15:46:12,understanding the spark that lead to the gme forest fire there are so many new users on wsb now and i think its safe to assume many of them are unaware of the humble beginnings of the gme story and how a handful of extremely dedicated intelligent and charismatic individuals worked tirelessly to reveal the true underlying value in the company and its potential to be turned around for these legends the short squeeze was always a factor in sight but their goal was to invest in a company they believed in and to lead others to the light alongside them for those who are here to fight the power fuck the system or just try and snatch some quick gains take some time to also explore the fundamentals revealed through the research and due diligence of og gme gang such as uuberkikz11 udeepfuckingvalue kjerill stjerne on twitter and michael burry i was lucky enough to host uuberkikz11 aka rod the boss alzmann on my podcast at the beginning of december after having recently opened my gme position who gave us the rundown of a lifetime largely thanks to rod the lives of my friendcohost have now changed forever i personally took profit and retained a portion of my position to let ride the wind to thank rod and the heroes who have lead us here i want to bring attention to this episode again then sit back and masturbate while the numbers on our podcast run up listen here

872,132,2021-01-29 16:44:14,an oversimplification of short ladders for anyone who still doesnt understand why todays dip happened uwolfyd33 recorded a baller audiobook version of this listen here go upvote his comment too ive gotten my mom interested enough in this that shes been loosely following it and she was massively confused today on how i knew not to panic sell obviously but you cant really verbalize that this is how i helped her grasp that the dip never really happened at all it ignores or misanalogizes certain aspects like the fact that the shares being traded often dont even exist but i think im correct on the essential mechanics im sleazy joe and i own a buyherepayhere car dealership john blow walks in with a cadillac escalade he wants to sell me johns escalade is worth $40000 or $50000 but im never going to make money if i pay him that so i need a way to convince him its worth less i have another escalade already on the lot and my friend sleazy jim owns another dealership across the street i pick up the phone and ask jim if he wants to buy a cadillac escalade for $38000 he accepts and i fax him the title two minutes later i get a call from jim and lo and behold he has a cadillac escalade to sell me for $36000 i accept and he faxes me the title back we keep doing this until we get to something pitiful like $8000 and now i have something i can print off and show john to say im sorry but the market value for your vehicle is what it is and i cant justify offering you more than that john doesnt have access to the specific people behind the sales hes looking at and although he does have access to the fact that very few escalades actually changed hands on the way down to $8000 he probably doesnt know to look at that let alone what it implies so he throws his hands up and i get his $40000 escalade for $8000 this is what happened today with gme institutions were doing incredibly volumethin rapid sales back forth between themselves at precipitously decreasing prices because they wanted $500 or $10000 depending upon how you look at it gme for $125 whats more they managed to get brokers to almost completely lock retail out so it couldnt correct by buying the dip greatly increasing the amount of downward movement they were able to simulate importantly it looks like they largely failed but worse such attacks will happen as they get more desperate and longs seeing through them is the only thing that can make them continue to fail tldr read the post but almost none of the sales that created the gme dip today were people actually exiting their positions or daytrading institutions sold the stock back forth to one another rapidly enough to create the impression of a mass selloff and faced almost no resistance doing so because of rh et als lockout
957,123,2021-01-29 16:31:10,guys gamestop should leverage their market cap and create the next major streaming platform for gamers serious ok so this could be bigger than mixer think about it theres only two major live streaming platforms targeted towards gaming twitch and youtube i wont even mention facebook streaming because that is something for plus the youtube livestream ui is pretty factor in gmes interest of expanding into esports it would be more profitable in the long run for them if they owned their own streaming platform and not have to share profits with twitch or youtube this would also be cheaper than a game dev studio which ive seen a lot of people mention those have massive overhead and limited to profits once every 3 years or so and no one wants to compete with fortnite to pile on theres some major streamers out there that currently cannot stream together on air and theres no alternative platforms on the market to entertain you retards on for those that dont know twitch wont let partners stream with other members that were banned forcing exiled streamers to youtube with zero alternative this forces streamersentertainers into a corner and it sucks to be cornered without any options these 2 streaming services hold too much power over their talent and it reminds me a lot of our showdown with wallstreet fuckheads like melvin steven cohen and citron and lets face it i dunno about you but i really want to see drd and timmythetatman playing with each other on stream again because i miss those two playing together also youtube livestream player is hot garbage and remains a total afterthought because google knows streamers have no alternatives effectively cornering the market i l believe a platform like this would totally justify the current share price as well gme to the moon positions 740 shares of gme tldr if gme created a gaming livestream platform they could leverage it for their esports scene and it would let timmythetatman and drdisrespect play together on stream again
72,11,2021-01-30 01:37:34,your gme shares might be lent to shortsellers your gme shares might be lent to shortsellers this information has been discussed frequently the last view weeks but may be new to the millions of autists and retards that joined in the last few days you might be suppressing the stock by allowing your shares to be lent out to shorters when can my shares be lent out if you have a margin account and are using the margin your shares are lent out by your broker to short sellers same thing when you are in a share lending program ibkr and schwab have those for example how can i make it stop if its possible cancel your enrollment in the share lending program or buy new stocks only in a cash account or something but im retarded and no financial advisor so better google and look in here the post i mostly ripped off for this btw i like gme comment if you have more information like how to opt out of your brokers program

165,288,2021-01-29 17:41:19,what if they just dont cover now hear me out and maybe im ignoring some fundamentals of finance here but this is just another autists perspective what if the shorts just continue to hold their positions in gme without covering sure we might have the stock runup on friday when options are executed but what then wont it cost the big hedge funds less to just hold and wait rather than cover now and risk blowing up their entire fund can someone please explain why they cant do this and why my theory is stupid x200b edit im not talking about options expiring tomorrow which will 100 force them to buy im asking about the short interest is it possible for them to pay the interest for the foreseeable future without covering i feel like if they cover rn at 1k it will be far more costly than paying the interest for a few months edit 2 seems like the explanation is that they cant keep paying the interest rates forever which makes sense but does anyone know the current interest rates theyre paying

2511,168,2021-01-30 01:25:27,index fund only investor checking in i never buy or sell individual securities but today i made an exception i am a 29yearold boomer i have a stable job and a solid investment strategy that involves budgeting living frugally and putting every cent that i have into vanguard index funds for the sweet compounding interest over time i messed around with stocks and options in my youth but after losing a bunch of $ i swore that off for life that changed today i have been watching this whole thing unfold from the sidelines at first i thought you all were just a bunch of moneyhungry opportunists who would sell off as soon as gme hit $100 but you didnt sell then the price rose to $300 i saw posts of people who made millions literal lifechanging money yet people did not sell i didnt quite understand at first but after reading post after post about how hedge fund bankers ruined lives in 2008 and continue to ruin lives with blatant market manipulation behind closed doors its now extremely evident to me that the system is simply rigged against the common person i used to believe the narrative that anyone could make a killing in the stock market if they just played the game right well here you all are playing the game right buying stocks because you like them and think the value is higher than they doand the entire system is saying oh never mind making money in stocks is not for you common peasants we need to keep you poor and stupid i am simply astounded at the level of determination and diamond hands of this community i dont know what this will do or if anyone will see this or what the real endgame here actually is but all i know is that you all have these hedge fund billionaires scared shitless for the first time in their lives and as someone who swore never to get involved in individual securities i just bought gme i wont ever sell this when i am 75 and look at my portfolio i want to see my gme position and be reminded of this moment whether its $1 or $1000 i will not sell psa i am not doing this out of some scheme i like the stock i like gamestop i have fond memories of waiting outside for hours to grab a copy of halo 2 on release day plain and simple edit i meant boomer as in my mentality i have a pair of grass cutting shoes i go to bed at like 9 i glare at kids who walk on my lawn and i like to see dividend distributions come in you know all that retarded boomer shit edit 2

0,36,2021-01-30 01:12:29,gentle reminder of reality for new investors i dont know if this tidbit of info will apply to you but to ppl who are buying gme at these high prices and who have never invested before you should know that gme is inevitably going to be worth less than $100 again sometime in the near future nobody knows when though but this is a pump and dump at its finest if you buy at $300 and it goes up to $500 will you sell and take $200 profit or will you hold thinking it will go to $1000 will you sell at $1000 you must have an exit strategy what if it tanks back down to $10 thats very likely make sure that you do not invest your life savings into these yolo plays also people who are getting rich from owning options not even owning shares exclusively have 10000 returns at this point the only way to have a 10000 return on stock is if the price went to $30000 per share good luck with that tldr be very careful and research before you throw everything you own into a meme stock x200b the fact that im being downvoted is evidence that this sub has become a pump and dump empire for ponzi scheme wallstreet hacks

192,35,2021-01-29 22:59:07,the balance of power retail vs hedge funds as weve seen yesterday the financial system is slightly more complicated than it looks we buy a stock on our brokerage webull etrade tda fidelity charles and they process it for us with their clearing house and their exchange big boys like fidelity do their clearing inhouse while webull for example uses tdc they put up the collateral for the risk and then it gets processed the shutdown yesterday was due to clearing houses raising the collateral requirements due to high volatility which itself is a result of the low liquidity now how does a hedge fund do its clearing they use something that is called a prime brokerage the process is the same there are just different requirements as it is usual in the big boys club so if we were to pick a random hedge fund like lets say melvin capital how do they do their clearing who is their prime brokerage its the very same people that brought the 2008 financial crisis to your doorstep goldman sachs jpmorgan and morgan stanley those are the companies that hold the risk if melvin goes under they are the one that would margin call melvin if they were to ever margin call them this is of course no financial advise but if i was goldman i would pick up the phone and start dialling to margin call gabe because gme is going to the moon disclaimer im actually on the spectrum and have my entire knowledge from either youtube or wikipedia i dont understand reality and you shouldnt follow anything anyone says least of all the media

142,156,2021-01-29 22:28:36,did hedge funds cover any shorts yesterday  i barely do any dd because im stupid af but i cant shake the feeling that they used this moment as a ploy for some hedge funds to not only cover their short position as much as they could but for them to also create a dip large enough for mm to jump in as well think about all the times shitron did an idiotic report to produce a dip for them to jump in the rallybull run then they use all these political tactics to sweep some sharescalls right in with half of us not being able to see options pricesblocks and movements since restrictions they couldve definitely made some ground back i honestly hope they didnt i want hf to learn from this and not fuck with their other 98 of the population since they can manipulate whatever they want fuck melvin fuck citron and fuck mms that fight so hard for us not to get a piece of the pie theyd rather die losing it all than them knowing college kids come up so much in a year than they have in 30 years tldr i hope they didnt cover shorts and use the dip to sneak in a position of their own gme to the moon
232,38,2021-01-29 22:08:25,rh shouldnt be the scapegoat real change needs to happen they should not be the only main point apologies for the political post i too cant wait for the loss porn to resume listen up retards what needs to happen for real change to happen is have every broker be held accountable for market manipulation robinhood sued to oblivion of course bc of how many regular users were fucked and the deception with the name congress members also need to be held accountable for trading and having insider info used to their advantage personally i think they should not be allowed to actively trade individual stocks as long as theyre in office we should not draw attention away from what causes real change doing so only adds patch and puts us in the same place with no real change with all that said this still has lobbyists as a problem but it would bring us closer to real change than ever before thoughts additional ideas inb4 tldr edit for all the smooth brains saying im melvinvlad lmao just lmao check my postcomment history ive been in this community wayyy before today positions 508 shares of gme

714,97,2021-01-29 21:47:47,more disinformation coming yesterday was a taste of whats to come while i know today may not be the day the squeeze fully happens it is a crucial day first robinhood is still preventing gme to be bought theyre only allowing up to 5 shares per account if you have more they wont let you add second i would put money on all brokers to be down at market open this has happened 2 days ago and will happen again what happens when the price goes down and brokers are down retail gets scared and runs for the door thirdly shitron is back on the scene he says he has a major announcement at 9am est while very vague you can bet your ass it will involve gamestop i expect right at that time the price to drop from more shorting by the players involved to scare paper hands and kill momentum right before market open what can you do if youre not already all in gme set buy orders to create buy walls so the price wont go down as much conspiracy pointthe money grab if the sec wants to bailout citadel what will happen is they will halt gme at some point today for the remainder of the day or even worse 10 days the sec can suspend a companys stock for up to 10 trading days how would this suspension bailout citadel they would make billions from option contracts expiring today and next friday buying call options on gme right now is a very dangerous game the squeeze would still happen after halting stopped but now citadel would take money from retail call holders to give it to retail shareholders i want to finish by saying that gme is a war between retail and wall street you should know by now that we face very powerful entities on the other side of the trade do not invest more than youre willing to lose buy stock instead of options to be safe and do not sell until the shorts cover p s not financial advice i just really like this stock p s s 
27256,1546,2021-01-29 21:11:53,robinhood is lying you are blocked acquiring more than 5 total shares vlad ceo of rh and chief mod at rcuckold went on national news outlets last night and swore rh would open trading of gme that is not entirely true rh is allowing anyone with zero shares of gme to buy up to 5 anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares this is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of gme shares and reduce liquidity they are simultaneously 1 manipulating the system 2 taking advantage of people with less funds 3 preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased they did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say we reopened stock purchase of gme and nobody will dig deeper this is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation heres the video proof edit and yes i do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine shout out to my homies at sofi fidelity and vanguard i have gme stashed in those accounts too edit 2 im not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too thomas the shit engine fluffer at ibkr can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too saying gme is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because its overvalued fuck you fluffer you know whats overvalued at $17 your shitty blowjobs you give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck no homo

338,41,2021-01-29 20:56:10,black swans wreaking the hedgesagain fellow degenerates what you might or might not have realised is that the $gme saga has opened a huge pandoras box across various aspects of our society politics economy and finance what is really fascinating is this has been destined for the lack of a better word to happen wsb degenerates arent to be blamed for anything let me introduce you to a super smart guy called nassim nicholas taleb he has more brain wrinkles than all of this sub combined who wrote at length about black swan events dr michael burry seems to have some sort of an inate affinity towards finding these birds just before they fuckup the entire financial system x200b dr burry next to black swans at leeds castle in kent england so taleb criticized the risk management methods used by the finance industry and warned about financial crises subsequently profiting from the late2000s financial crisis i wouldnt be surprised if he loaded up on $gme calls too lmao he advocates what he calls a black swan robust society meaning a society that can withstand difficulttopredict events he proposes antifragility in systems that is an ability to benefit and grow from a certain class of random events errors and volatility as well as convex tinkering as a method of scientific discovery by which he means that decentralized experimentation outperforms directed research for you smoothbrains this means that a wsb type setup where research and experimentation is open sourced and done by millions of decentralized degenerates will always trump a hedge fund type setup where this centralized and vertically directed usually by the cio or pm here is talebs recent tweet gme not a single movement in game stop was an outlier with a standard power law with tail index 18 not a single one i believe x axis means daily $gme price movement and the y axis means the probability of it happening the farther to right the bigger price movement so what does this mean what this means is that $gmes stock movement isnt as special as it seems to be everyone read cnbc fuck you wapner boomerberg cnn and even the fucking hedge funds were surprised calling it irrational devoid of any reason or logic question is why were they surprised the answer is because hedge fund models couldnt forecast shit their models are worthless trash and they have been proven wrong again and again this is exactly the same stupid lesson ltcm didnt learn in 1998 and lehman in 2008 hedge funds tried picking up pennies in front of a steamroller and got crushed this time shorting companies into the ground taleb calls these thick tailed events extreme events away from the centre of the distribution play a very large role black swans are not more frequent they are more consequential the fattest tail distribution has just one very large extreme deviation rather than many departures from the norm this is the rationality of common people with a good tail risk detector your spidey sense compared to the ignorance of experts read hedge funds mms and other wall street dementors if we visibly incur tiny risk of ruin but have a frequent exposure the probability of what happened to $gme would have gone to 1 anywaybasically what can break and is irreversible will eventually break shorting 140 of $gmes float is exactly that from dr burrys 2008 letter to investors i have found markets to be anything but random and i find many of the future events that are bound to be dismissed as random or explainable only in hindsight in fact can be foretold in time with the rhythm of history if one does the work and foretold they did udeepfuckingvalue and dr burrys spidey sense were right all along and predicted this all the way from 2019 tldr you degenerates are not the problem you are the solution $gme obligatory i am not a financial advisor in fact i am a financial bonehead and that doesnt know shit

523,30,2021-01-29 20:06:17,retail buying of heavily shorted stocks is not market manipulation ive seen a lot of memes to the effect of wall street manipulates markets but gets mad when regular people do it lol i get the spirit of these memes and enjoy them but they do create the false impression that retail buying as a result of info on these forums constitutes actual market manipulation it doesnt gme is hardly the first heavily shorted stock to get squeezed and holding when stocks are going up double digits every day is just getting the most out your investment especially if you bought under the initial thesis that the truly insane short interest would cause a price increase your thesis was then proved correct and the short interest remained 100 to constitute market manipulation it must be proven 1 that the accused had the ability to influence market prices 2 that the accused specifically intended to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand 3 that artificial prices existed and 4 that the accused caused the artificial prices copied from a bloomberg article per this definition restricting buying actually would constitute manipulation as it creates an artificially low demand for a stock in turn driving down cost but the brokerages have done that not us if they dont have money to cover 570cs if they go itm maybe they shouldnt have sold them to begin with fuck em cut back on the lattes tldr a bunch of people on reddit buying gme not market manipulation
212,162,2021-01-29 20:03:14,sell your other stocks now in a rush to get cash to cover their positions and somehow get out of their fucked up trades hedgefunds can and will sell other positions im assuming this could trigger a major dip for the whole market once they start selling big positions to cover their asses market as a whole is pretty uncertain anyway if another gammasqueeze hits today and actually triggers the short squeeze they have to get out or go bust with cash they dont have right now that will fuck up a lot of other stocks for sure but propel gme to fucking sun and beyond
20374,1348,2021-01-29 19:50:03,explaing how we won yesterday and how we have the potential to destroy all the hedge funds that shorted gme and change the entire financial system forever disrupting the clearinghouses themselves i have to start his post that i am retarded and that this is not financial advice you all here do your own research and make your own decisions all i know is that i like the stock x200b tldr at the bottom x200b i do not think that you all here realize that we have essentially won yesterday at 958 am and that we almost crashed the entire thing there was a post here describing a 30 seconds from triggering market nuclear bomb in this post they described and expressed their outrage with the interactive brokers chairman interview they are correct there was another interview with anthony denier ceo of webull that i did not see that received as much attention here in this interview it is a bit longer must watch imo it explains some of the ambiguity with the previous interviews with vlad from robinhood and what happened in general it confirms that 1 they had a liquidity problem 2 the shorts are starting to go bust 3 the brokers are on the hook to get shares that their clients cant get 4 the brokers themselves cannot cover these positions properly 5 the clearing house also cannot cover and are getting loans from the banks due to the capital requirements x200b essentially we liked the stock so much that the shorties all my homies hate melvin capital and shitron blew up so fast that the brokers could not properly margin call them in time they could not liquidate them in time to get them to cover their positions in time now the brokers are on the hook to go get the shares for you if their clients cannot this is why there is a margin call and margin maintenance to avoid this from happening but we blew past all of this so fast that they are now on the hook since their clients the now cannot get the share that they legally need to provide you since these brokers are large they usually have the capital to cover these losses and get the shares themselves as thomas peterffy flexes that he has billions to cover when i heard it first has made me raise my eyebrows since why would he flex this number and then highlight the 15billion losses then it hit me they cannot cover these positions these brokers are starting to not be able to clear these transactions so their clearing house does it for them the clearing house in short makes sure that when you sell your share you get your money in your account they usually have about 12 of capital requirements for the stock that is being traded to make sure that they can settle the transaction however for gme it is raised to a 100 the clearing house cannot settle these transactions once robinhoods clearinghouse went down the transactions started getting routed through webulls clearing house i belive it is apex that they use they almost immediately had to put a halt on it because they could not settle the transactions they started taking loans from banks to keep themselves from halting the entire stock market the entire stock market was about to collapse because they were about to not be able to settle the transactions there is not enough stock to go around at this point what that all means is that there is not enough stock to go around and the loses of these are so large that the brokers cannot get the shares that they are legally bound to do and their clearing house cannot do it either this is why they stopped you from buying but allowed selling they used the short ladder attack and essentially in a low volume caused the price to drop by trading in between themselves to a point where they were sort of able to cover some losses but in the middle of this short ladder attack the most beautiful thing happened everyone held from luis rossmanns video 618 bid vs ask price difference is massive look at that difference between bid and ask i love all of you you all that shit so hard x200b you yes you reading this because you that shit the price did not drop further because of every single one of you they were not able to cover their positions x200b what this all means is that we are close to winning and we will not only take out the greedy hedge fund managers but also the brokers the clearing houses and the whole thing x200b now this all means that we are very very very close to winning at this point if we manage to get all these options to exercise in the money today it will be 15million 20 million shares that will have to be bought up by the market makers this is the gamma squeeze that is probably going to happen today and would then cause the squeeze to the moon x200b at this point i plan to hold and you should too if we keep drying out these clearing houses brokers like fidelity do not have clearing houses and there you should be able to buy freely the more we clear them out the more they will have to cover and we have a chance for a real financial revolution x200b x200b tldr the brokers have let their clients lose so much money so fast that they were not able to margin call them in time and now they are on the hook to provide the shares the losses are so large that they the broker are not able to provide the share and then the clearing house has to do it the clearing house cannot provide the shares because of the capital requirements for gme and they are borrowing from the banks this is creating a liquidity problem that can affect the entire market buy them out and then buy on brokers like fidelity that do not have a clearing house this is why they stopped allowing gme to be bought but you could still sell it because they wanted to save their own asses everyone here managed to so hard that caused the price to stop falling and the bidask price to increase drastically i am buying and holding gme to the moon i have 15 shares $4044 not much i know but i am gonna reload asap and i am planning to sell 1020 at $10k and hold to sell the rest of my position at $4206969share x200b edit i should have made it more clear for people that are asking about what to do if they do the same halt on buys use brokers that do not rely on clearing house like fidelity 
269,147,2021-01-29 19:49:53,most of you may have deleted robinhood but they are now allowing buying 5 gmes tldr you may be allowed to buyhold upto 5 gme shares on robinhood i have never seen anyone tell me you can only buy and hold up to x shares of this company robinhood writes opening new positions in the securities listed in the table below is currently allowed but limited for more context about the decision to limit these securities read our blog post edit missed the rockets 
246,69,2021-01-29 19:49:20,what you can do to bring down the share float and further the short squeeze here to tell you how scared the wall st bullies really are because of this revolution of ours first of all diamond hands hold on to your gme shares do not sell not selling will obviously reduce the float of available shares in the market so when the shorts do cover they have to buy the same shares again and again and again to cover their 120 percent short positions the short is 120 percent of total shares outstanding mind you that the float is much much lower than os shares due to activist investors like burry and cohen when the shorts cover may have to buy upto 5 to 6 times the float to fully exit their positions according to some of my analyst friends when that happens it will no longer be about hundreds of dollars but much much more hold on until then call your brokers up and ask them to not lend your shares short this artificially reduces float and will absolutely murder the shorts on payday now that were at brokers lads quit robinhood and get a better broker there are many brokers that arent licking citadels arse some of my american friends can help with a list in the comments to those who have options expiring today or anytime soon do not sell exercise these options if you can and hold the shares call up your broker and tell them youd like to exercise your options they will be legally obligated to deliver you your shares then which will again reduce float anything that reduces float shoves a rod up the hedgies arse this is a defining moment in financial history buy hold be a part edit im a retard not a financial advisor i love the stock

227,23,2021-01-30 06:30:39,common sense regulation by a retard because cnbc guests wont talk about it i have had cnbc up 247 to watch the shitshow happen on there i know i shouldnt be to support our boi udeepfuckingvalue but i gotta know how the opposition is looking the common thread among most of the supporters of big money is this let the sec figure out how to regulate this i dont want to comment even aocs stream including her guests wouldnt say anything i think its very important we voice our opinion on this we need to let regulators know what we want if you disagree you can downvote thats the great thing about this i have 10 years of game design experience and at the end of the day wall street is a game with rules so i felt like i could give us a voice here so lets make the rules a bit more fair and less broken so my policy idea is simple cashsecured shorts puts are cash secured why shouldnt shorts be unlimited downside is monumentally stupid weve seen that concept broken down with this play so how would this work simple when someone places a short they have to set a max cash loss with it this amount is cash secured and set aside so long as your short is live this can be either done as a monetary value or a stop loss style tool if you want to sell options into that you can but if your stop loss triggers the option is market purchased back much like a margin call the short can still lose more than the cash secured amount but it will be small enough to account for it wont have infinite downside and will constrict mass short selling benefits 1 this allows short sellers to bet down without letting them do naked shorts with insane leverage 2 there will never be a solvency issue with shorts again at least not from shorts 3 shortbased market manipulation will become much much harder cons 1 this does not solve overtrading the float which is not the problem you can still get 140 float with shorts at least itll be cash secured 2 short selling strategies will become much more limiting due to having to put up collateral 3 short squeezes can still occur and will be far easier to trigger this way i think this will make short sellers think twice about trades they make and the 140 problem will go away 4 it takes a little bit of work for brokerages to build a new system to change the way shorts are traded 5 education will have to happen fortunately its usually only big money that shorts so theyll figure it out fast from a user experience perspective this isnt a difficult addition to their system cash secured puts are already in place so the monetary hold can be reused they will have to add a new bar that incorporates a selection tool for their cash secured value this is more complex ui than just allowing a straight sale of a shorted stock but its only one row they can manage that in any brokerage appsystem i believe my system will save the market from ever experiencing another shortbased solvency issue margin can still be traded into shorts but that becomes hedged by the people offering the margin thus still keeping everything cash secured if you have anything youd like to add to this or correct feel free lets give the regulators something to work off of many dont seem to even know how this system works so we cant leave it up to big money to teach them what they need to do to fix this well end up getting screwed in the name of retail protection if anyone can help share this please do i dont have twitter i think getting this upvoted will spread the idea and im hoping youtubers and other people spread it or at least discuss it hold gme 
4121,271,2021-01-30 05:26:25,filing a lawsuit against robinhood i will be filing a lawsuit against robinhood i had 2 gme $115 call options expiring today they were obviously very in the money i was holding and watching the latest short attack play out when my options were sold and executed at the lowest point they were today like all robinhood customers i received an email today at 128pm stating that they may exercise or sell options expiring today due to market volatility my options were sold at 222pm i am aware of robinhoods 300pm cutoff time to sell this was different this is blatant market manipulation and my options were illegally sold without my consent news organizations feel free to contact me edit screenshot edit 2 i did not buy on margin i had the cash to cover one of the calls earlier today in case i exercised but instead chose to buy a call option for next friday i got the email about them having the ability to do this right after buying that option so i was stuck edit 3 class action firm im using 
1048,94,2021-01-30 05:22:56,i know this is mentally draining watching the price go up and down remember years ago our fellow comrade elon musk had two companies spacex and tesla on a brink of collapse he has held on to those companies as he believed in them look at him now look at those two companies being at top of their game tesla bringing us into the electric world and spacex taking us to another world soon called mars just like every single one of us is believing in the short squeeze we hold our shares its mentally draining its fun and not so fun at the same time if we look past the horizon we can see the tendies rising like the sun in the morning these are our tendies within a hand reach so hold the fuck on to your gme shares like there is no tomorrow tldr hold this is not a financial advise i am not a financial advisor i am writing up a scifi post do what you wish with your shares and investments
6364,614,2021-01-30 05:08:40,the short squeeze has not begun so heres the deal gme shorts are going to try and push the price down pretty hard before market close but dont sell the gamma squeeze wont happen until after todays close the short squeeze is not happening until after the gamma squeeze pushes the price up of gme to serious margin call levels thats when the hedge funds who are shorting the stock must cover their margin calls hence the the short squeeze begins for all the people who cant read hold then stonks go up next week
1545,212,2021-01-30 03:30:46,if the market crashes now theyll try to blame it on us i just saw a news article that said if gme continues to rise it could cause losses to brokers and force hedge funds to sell other securities to raise cash it said this may ripple through the financial markets keep kicking their asses guys but just be ready if things go down then they will be the first fuckers on cnbc telling your grandma that her retirement disappeared because some retards tried to take everyones money the game is rigged and theyll milk this for everything they can 
177,86,2021-01-30 03:28:32,consider hedging your non yolo accounts if we accidentally set off a market correction now you have the opportunity to mitigate risk look i get gme is exciting my own f5 button is getting worn but consider if these large hedge funds have to liquidate and we get a snowball effect hitting the broader market every day we see various analysts screeching about bubbles and market tops and while it is easy to ignore them remember we are up significantly compared to a year ago despite lockdown etc if you have an account full of boring boomer stuff like actual shares of spy and so on listen up if youre in for the long run you probably dont need to worry but if you might need the money in the not too distant future at least consider hedging with some otm puts on spy or some other index these obviously need to be long dated ideally 12 months out dont devote too much perhaps 12 see it as plunge protection it might not cover the entire drop and chances are theyll just lose value but if we do set off something wider here you might walk away happier as usual not financial advice but at least bear it in mind and decide whether it is worth it or not position otm put on local index europoor checking in about 15 off current level equivalent to 1 of invested funds
170,39,2021-01-30 03:22:45,gamestop should issue more shares and declare themselves an esports spac a ten percent new issue would get absorbed like nothing and they could go grab a deal on a company that they or we think this on its way up take 3 billion and merge with somebody who was planning to go public what an opportunity for publicity and positive branding i think there are a lot of companies that think what this sub is doing is worthy of support gme represents freedom and millennials and all kinds of heroic shit now it would amount to a multi step all stock deal essentially this sub can actually turn this company around and justify the price by keeping it high enough to generate huge reserves edit ok so split shares not a new issue i still think its a good idea
282,113,2021-01-30 03:02:49,institutional ownership of gme is well over 100 how do shorts cover per it seems that the institutional ownership of gme is at 160 the largest shareholders are 1 fmr llc 1763 2 blackrock inc 1320 3 rc ventures llc 1290 4 dimensional fund advisors lp 1081 5 vanguard group inc 837 6 state street corp 584 7 senvest management llc 554 8 foss donald a 530 9 hestia capital partners lp 508 10 ubs asset management americas inc 480 11 permit capital llc 479 12 scion asset management llc 430 13 royce associates lp 229 total institutional ownership in just the top 13 companies 10085 this isnt counting the board of directors either so unless a lot of institutional people sell the shorts cannot cover add that to the millions of shares in call options expiring itm today there are going to be millions of shares bought and delivered on mondaytuesday not sold on those days delivered that is just buying pressure additionally according to s3 partners llc open short interest as of this morning is still 58mm shares tldr there are more institutional shares than total shares while short interest is 113 of float edit its important to consider that some of these institutional owners could have rebalanced or exited their positions entirely for instance yesterday must asset management disclosed that they sold all their gme shares on 123120 so there can be a month delay in the reporting
1694,175,2021-01-30 02:59:34,we need to keep price above $320 by end of day there is a massive volume of currently itm calls at $320 if i were a short id be waiting till end of day to launch an attack to hopefully leave these calls unexercisable in order to rebuff an attack there needs to be enough buying at that price to counteract the momentum of the attack ive set a limit buy order at $320 for what i can afford if youre looking for a good entry point this is it this is a huge battle in the war of gme if you currently are holding itm options for gme and have the funds to exercise do it especially if theyre fringe a short attack or another round of cheating could make them useless any second worst case scenario there is also a large volume of puts at $300 and an even larger volume at $115 if $320 is too high consider $300 or even $115 if theyre able to close those out its a huge loss for us this is not financial advise position 160 avg 2550 
29187,1581,2021-01-30 02:54:21,a small reminder of some of the risks involved there is a prevailing misunderstanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the market price this is false you are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order the idealized scenario is that gme rallies melvin covers and everyone at reddit gets out at the top this represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics melvin will cover before we truly know it and the crash will happen as quick as the rally so with recent events you must ask yourself who is your counterparty nothing is a sure bet how confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is thousands of redditors new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that melvin capital hasnt exited their trade this is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms although their estimates differ some amount confounded in this is the interpretation of the data does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened its tough to know for sure know everyones hand your guess on how much theyve covered and when they covered has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade buying if you think melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover you also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze the difference between the two represents your effective edge remember we dont actually know melvins current position we dont know whats going on behind closed doors we only know the hand theyre showing us via media has their clearing firm taken over has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position have they been buying since monday have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level you are fighting goliath at a poker table in the city of gath the pot is worth $25 billion dollars ken griffin has never lost melvins prime brokers morgan stanley goldman sachs deutsche are not used to losing well deutsche is they will do whatever it takes to take the pot from you and leave you holding the bag they will not blink twice because there is a lot of fucking money on the line know what can go wrong nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week prepare yourself for the unexpected your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time the stock could be halted for days you could be assigned on itm options your stock could get delisted your stock may get diluted only spend what youre willing to lose this one is self explanatory your investment could go to zero even if you think you make money on every trade if your bet size is 100 the long term value of your portfolio is zero dont take out loans on emotional capital if you are new you really dont know the gutwrenching stomachturning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative it fucking sucks you just know the highs youre buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies wrapped in antibillionaire prounderdog themes it may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance we love the feeling if you are fully invested financially emotionally you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price make feeling good your goal and set limits that you can stomach there are several feelgood stories of people making lifechanging money to pay off their student loans or their family members surgeries please think twice about this and only spend what you can afford to lose if placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying you may have a gambling problem these were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending secondly dont take it personal there are people on the other side of your trades your brokerage support line the subreddit the media they are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge its easy to blame a broker yell at their support desk hatetweet at a company or even ragetext that guy you know who develops apis at etrade a lot of people across the industry are rooting for you fuck even ted cruz and aoc are rooting for you because this transcends politics if youre mad at melvin capital or ken griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008 keep it that way they will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction brokerages the media and reddit if your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers keep it that way thirdly if you dont want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side be a human being for your wallets sake you make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions
248,76,2021-01-30 02:29:34,why brokerages shut down buys for gme and others ok ive watched webull ceo interview read few things here and here is my understanding of the situation i knew next to nothing about stock market just a month ago so take it with a grain of salt here is a diagram of roles showing how money exchange hands these are just roles some companies act as multiple roles dtc buybroker clearing company 3 days clearing company sellbroker when we buy or sell money dont exchange hands immediately they go via clearing process where roughly speaking they just record all transactions then settle the balance with each other every 3 days with a single balancing payment it is important to understand that balancing payment is much less than total volume of trade between clearing companies because on average everyone trades with everyone for this particular trade 3 day delay means that sellers clearing company is on the hook they already paid seller but real money for this deal will come later what if buyers clearing company goes down nobody likes to be exposed so the mechanism of collateral was invented all clearing companies deposit cash in custodian dtc to guarantee that if counterparty goes bankrupt they are not at loss or at least exposure is calculated upfront and accounted for its logical that collateral is calculated in proportion to the expected balancing payment when wsb started trading all expectations were off all risk models were out of the window there was a risk that melvin capital wont be able to pay for the stocks they are buying or more precisely wont be able to clear 3 days down the line when settlement is due this in turn would bankrupt other clearing companies on the market causing cascading effect so custodian dtc being in a risk management business decided that gme stocks causes to much risk and demanded 100 collateral what does it mean in practice now suddenly clearing companies need to deposit 100 of whole gme volume they are trading which is much more than what they could afford immediately they had no option other than to refuse to clear gme trades which in turned caused rh webull others to shut buys why european companies continue to trade i dont know maybe their clearing process is much faster minutes hours and their exposure is much less as a result so collateral requirements are significantly lower this isnt mine credit urossmohax this is not financial advice buy gme x200b edit fixed the diagram edit 2 clearing companies wanted higher collateral but this still was suits dictating the rules edit 3 citadel is both a hedge fund and a clearing company so they have their hands in that pot as well edit 4 fellow retard in comment section umassdev addressed what my post didnt problem is with your analysis is that it only fucks buy side which makes no sense because you are getting capital in exchange for paper sell side is the exposure and was allowed to continue because the cunts tried to collude together to exit their worst short positions and shake out paper retail hands with a short ladder melvins position being untenable isnt a cascade or systemic failure as evidenced by they still exist and they are still trying to salvage their position while being propped up by the market makers clearing houses and platforms this isnt a game for the whole enchilada by the time regulation legislation and punitive catches up this will be long over the naked short selling created the opportunity that is the root of the problem and that smart money didnt butcher them shows sharks dont eat sharks
131,45,2021-01-30 02:12:23,margin maintenance requirements being jacked up to force margin calls with little changes to my portfolio since monday my margin maintenance has tripled this is due to rh raising these requirements based on the implied volatility in bb and nok would be the same for gme but luckily you fucks are smart and are not buying on margin it is not possible for me to easily move to another brokerage or simply turn off margin for those who dont know how that shit works so im asking for help for myself and others that need a clever approach beyond adding funds or closing positions ill likely have to close for a huge loss but selling is what they want
635,44,2021-01-30 01:59:46,you guys have inspired me to a level ive never felt before paying off student loans paying off medical bills donations to important causes gaining autonomy and fucking over a system that has fucked you over for a long time ive legitimately never been this inspired i was just a little kid when 2008 happened and my dad had a stable enough job to where i didnt really need to be worried luckily i havent accrued a ton of crippling debt or medical needs yet either i understand thats not the case for everyone and seeing stories on here about how people fall into very bad situations shatters my heart and now i see you taking it all back some of you guys are risking everything not blinking at the sight of losing your life savings all for the chance of sending the strongest message the financial world has ever seen i may not have as much to put in but im holding for you guys the ones who could lose it all if this goes badly im holding for you yesterday i told my dad about my positions literally all gme hes always encouraged me to make smart investments so he was very skeptical alex they can find shady ways to get themselves out of this the share is worth $4 please get out in time this almost sounds like a ponzi scheme i heard it all from him in response i told him dad we can remain retarded longer than they can remain solvent i could see his faith in my investments drain from his face a good chunk of my family and friends think im pants on head retarded which i guess is true in its own right for continuing to hold when i couldve already sold for profit but im not fucking selling this is the most proud ive ever been to be a part of this sub ive been around for a while and ive never seen anything this preposterous happen maybe this sub will never go back to being the same after all the growth but wow what a fucking way to spark the change if thats the case source am retrad
124,29,2021-01-30 01:53:15,dtcs and clearinghouses the shadiness of yesterdays buying halt based on my understanding of the process of delivering money from a completed trade you sell your shares for a $10 gain the clearinghouse has to have that $10 and holds it for up to 2 days then they transfer the liability to a dtc who also has to have your $10 themselves then that dtc goes to the person buying the shares from you for the $10 you earned they then deliver that back to the clearinghouse or deliver it directly back to you the normal collateral rate that a dtc requires a clearinghouse to have is 2 they raised it to 100 yesterday is that unprecedented it seems like the sneakiest way the big suits could think to stop us from buying gme and starting the squeeze was to up the collateral to an unreasonable level knowing that the clearinghouses had no option but to ask brokers to stop letting people buy the stock it seems to me that some late night phone calls were made before yesterday to these dtcs to up that collateral requirement knowing that it makes it way less obvious that something corrupt is going on webulls ceo went on banzinga yesterday and explained this but i have seen zero coverage of this by cnbc it is so shady that robinhoods ceo didnt mention this once yet webulls ceo has no problem saying this on a small youtube channel x200b does that sound likely to any of you more advancedexperienced traders x200b webulls ceo starts to explains the process around 10620 you can skip to 10900 for more tldr info not a meetkevin shill i just found his channel yesterday x200b keep your diamond hands strong my boys
80,26,2021-01-30 01:52:51,idea aggregating different models to track gme short interest the short interest seems to be a big indicator of when the squeeze is happening one problem is every sites estimates are different for example ortex currently has it at 75 s3 has 113 marketwatch has 120 etc i wonder if thered be any value in creating a model that aggregates the gme short data from a bunch of different models so we can trend it even though none are fully accurate if they all drop around the same time that will be a clear sign that the squeeze is upon us and the tendyman cometh now i am not nearly enough of an autist to do any coding shit to create this model myself but if there are any programming wiz gigaautists reading this let me know if this might be worth pursuing or maybe its just retarded obligatory gme 
79,76,2021-01-30 01:34:48,a curious discussion of what happens next in the gme saga so first of all i love what wsb has done showing wallstreet and the government the power of the individual making hedge fund managers and the government show their real colors about what they care about money not you love it the fact that so many people are making money from it at the same time love it more gme is at an all time high which is awesome but what is to stop someone from short selling now i know basic trading but short selling is a bit over my head so forgive my ignorance if someone decided to short sell at the current price the bottom falls out and it drops back to single digits they would make a killing right so what is to stop wallstreet mofos from doing this yeah we may have screwed them out of some money temporarily but if they can do the scenario i just outlined then we are only making them their money back and then some in the long run also the cultish attitude of say nothing else just buy gme is a little odd and has an almost wallstreet mentality as opposed to a wsb fuck with the system mentality edit okay addendum to the scenario one learned commenter said the following they have shorted already and are running out of money but we all will sell eventually be in a couple daysweeksmonths people will grow bored of this and resell these stocks gme is basically doomed to go back to $050 stocks eventually so op wants to know whats stopping someone from shorting the stocks at their peak and buying them back when gme does and it will plummet back to a reasonable price i almost guarantee itll happen given this what is to stop me or anyone else in wsb from shorting today i mean we were the ones who got it to the price its at if we sell our shares then short it cant you basically make money going both ways 
144,44,2021-01-30 01:33:07,how to get around selling limits use a conditional trigger some of you are wondering why you can only set your sell limit so high i dont know how fidelity works but for tda this means going to the individual stock page and selecting set triggers check your other brokerages for similar language if gme last price 10000 create limit sell for 10000 youll now find your sell order under trade contingentorder status considering that we already have reports that rh was paying out up to 6k for fractional shares yesterday people are saying 10k is a very likely price target the price you select is up to you the above value is simply an example set your trigger accordingly i am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice the intent of this post is to make people more familiar with their trading platform as they appear flustered that they can only set a limit below what they want
661,169,2021-01-30 01:19:57,a big ol fuckin red day may be coming first off read the fucking tldr because im sick of responses from people who didnt even glance at the post congratulations and holy fuck to those of you in the gme squeeze i was a doubter i missed the boat entirely but i bought 3 shares this morning at an average of 334 and ill hold to oblivion seriously this 1k means absolutely nothing to me i went 999 cash yesterday and i will hold this last tiny remaining position until its a penny or i hit my sell limit at $4200 some of you may have seen this post yesterday i believe this is true this explains the broad market selloff of everything besides squeeze stocks this past week aside from yesterday and the continued bleed today now that the strategy of forcing the squeezers out by restricting trade seems to have failed i had 20k wiped off my account value in hours the other day thats not important because it was house money whats important is what caused that fear and the answer to that may be a liquidity crisis what happens if brokers like ibkr and rh fail if they are forced to admit margin is ineffective their risk management systems are flawed and short squeeze scenarios like this reveal that they do not have the ability to cover the cash that flows through their institutions what happens if these hedge funds who went naked short get fully liquidated in margin calls and dont have the money to back it up not only are we bound to see a firestorm of legislation that could scare the markets the actual void of money that will be created could tank everything what would the impacts be of robinhood failing if everyone who has their money in the market via rh pulls out because theyre not sure that their broker actually has the money to pay them tldr if the squeeze gets fully squoze i am pretty certain the entire market will tank with the exception of the squeeze stocks therefore please keep squeezing because i want cheap stocks edit changed from dd to discussion because its not researched enough and is mostly just me ranting

248,57,2021-01-30 00:12:11,gme squeeze explained by up08c some fundamentals for you retards hey all posting on behalf of up08c as his post keeps getting removed source alright im fucking retarded and i suck at math but ill give you a long drawn out post because ive got nothing better to do with my time first lets take a look at the yahoo finance page for gme according to the statistics gamestop has 6975m shares outstanding that is how many gamestop shares exist right below that youll see that gamestop has 4689m shares floating that is how many shares are actually in circulation and are tradeable now lets walk away from yahoo finance with those numbers in mind and go to according to this website 9768 of shares outstanding for gme are being shorted since we know that gme has 6975m shares and 9768 are shorted you can do the math and find that the total shorted shares for gme is around 6813m now that we know that there are 6813m shares being shorted we can compare that number to the 4689m shares floating do some more math and you see that 6813 is 145297504798465 of the total 4689m shares floating so we come to the conclusion that 9768 of the shares outstanding are shorted or 1453 of the float the shares that are actively being traded is shorted
2737,160,2021-01-30 00:04:10,finally some balance on cnbc which has been incredibly biased against us finally some balance on cnbc in a debate kevin oleary shark tanks mr wonderful the definition of the market is speculation when you buy and stay long in a stock you are speculating about the profits you hope appear and you take that risk the best thing we could do for this market right now is leave it alone and just shine the light of transparency on it if you are short let it be transparent and you now run the new risk that these effective social media vigilantes are going to come after you and squeeze you in your short and thats going to make a lot of hedge funds think a second time before they try and go short in a stock which i think it is great paraphrase we have 100s of millions of people who have nothing set aside for their retirement and along comes a platform that has millions of investorsand yes they will lose money as every investor does just shine transparency on it and finally he made the argument that cnbc ignores that gme now has a new lease on life how do you know that gamestop executives are not going to take advantage of this situation and make a pivot just like netflix did when they were shipping out cds in the mail anchor breaks in to say they need to protect the little guy from the big guy which is a joke since they only care about the big guy the only person i care about are the people who lost their jobs i really dont care if a few hedge funds go to zero who cares anchor what about the kids who take the stimulus checks and put it on margin and could go to bankruptcy they didnt learn investing in high school so let them learn in the real world i got so sick of cnbc yesterday that i ponied up for extra $14 a month for a cable package including bloomberg and it is so much more balanced and nuanced plus you get a lot more news of world markets and commodities cnbc really only covers us stocks which is only a fraction of the financialeconomic picture

619,269,2021-01-30 04:30:49,gme reality check days to cover short ratio as of 01292021 please read for autisms sake my fellow retarded brethren it is in my humble opinion that the information regarding melvin having 5 to 6 days to cover their shorts is not true anymore it may have been true at the beginning of the week but not anymore let me explain with links and shit for authenticity purpose 281 days open following link in incognito for multiple visits see the green line 115 days it is undoubtedly true that we simply do not know what is going on behind their closed doors we will never know so please verify any information from multiple reliable sources i also came across some images yesterday which were uploaded by a user who id like to credit but i cant find him so the source of following images is dude trust me 142 days x200b the short ratio heavily depends on the volume if there is a large enough volume and assuming melvin has been steadily covering which i personally believe they are it will hardly take them a day to cover if the data on any of those linksimages is true x200b just trying to spread awareness i could be entirely wrong here and i would welcome it if someone proved me wrong i am holding shares like a muthafucka theres no doubt about it i will continue to hold even if i am shitting my pants for every dip i see but please please try to verify all the information that youre reading holding since $3770share yours truly random diamond handed retard this isnt financial advice as i am a complete and total retard myself x200b edit some goddamn good information if true verbatim from uifromdafuture from the comments hijacking top comment i am a retard and this is not financial advice you guys are confusing volume with real retail volume total volume includes all the bullshit selling they are doing with each other retail volume is how much buying and selling is retail movement data shows that retail is providing very little sale side orders meaning that the dtc is most likely much longer than the predictions here because they can trade with each other all they fucking want but until retail starts to sell in volume they wont pull enough shares to cover x200b edit2 i have to include this because this is a damn good point as well verbatim from uyeswhathello we are seeing short interest remain high though my hypothesis is that the hedge funds covered their riskiest positions already and replaced those with new shorts betting that the price would come down from its $300 level right now imo short squeeze is still a possibility if the price goes up further or if through holding the price stays the same and hedgies get bored dont want to keep paying interest on their positions although personally i think this is less likely than momentum in gme dying down and retail traders taking profits

225,174,2021-01-30 04:10:23,misconceptions and bullshit this post might rub people the wrong way but i think its important to make sure accurate information is getting out there not financial advice stop messaging me asking what to do with your rent money just go blow your landlord shorts couldnt have covered because short interest is up this isnt true suppose melvin started covering their $20 shorts on tuesday afternoon around $100 and continued to cover as the price was squeezed up to $200 after hours that night margin calls go out and on wednesday morning all the small shorts cover or get liquidated squeezing the price up to $350 during that time institutions possibly including melvin open up new shorts between $250 and $350 short volume increases but those new short positions arent in any danger of getting squeezed unless retail drives the price to $400$500 short interest alone does not mean more squeezing is possible you have to consider borrowing rates entry points and the number of involved institutions too shorts couldnt have covered because volume was too low also not true the volume you see reported comes from the consolidated tape plan ctp exchanges and ecns dark pools are required to report trade information as it happens to the ctp for aggregation and redistribution out to all institutions and brokers who then pass it down to their clients in the form of price and volume graphs but not all trading happens on venues that are subject to ctp reporting for example gabe plotkin of melvin could have simply called a few hedge fund buddies he knows to be long gme and cut a deal he could also have gone to a citadel and directly swapped out his shorts for higher priced shorts paying the difference as a premium sort of like rolling a short call out and having citadels market maker operations cover from their book at the cost of liquidity for retail traders or he could have used citadels loan to buy calls to collateralize his shorts cta reported volume does not tell the whole story keep buying and well squeeze out the new shorts retail buying power is probably going to get exhausted at some point the initial argument for the gme squeeze was hey look this company is undervalued overshorted and cheap now the valuation is much higher and its no longer cheap enough for retail to move easily and especially calls calls are so expensive now that gamma squeezing to initiate a short squeeze is a lot harder squeezing shorts that got in at $400 is going to be hard and if you did squeeze them out they will short again at $500 or $600 the higher the price and the less unreasonable the short entry points the harder it will be to squeeze market makers will have to buy tons of shares today probably not to be honest market makers adjust their positions dynamically to remain delta neutral they dont just wait until the last minute to hedge sometimes like during gamma squeezes they fall behind and they get stuck with a directional position on the stock and have to catch up later but yesterdays conveniently timed retail trader lockout kept gamma low and prices suppressed so there was plenty of time to catch up you never know what could happen after hours especially if a lot of options a right at the money but dont expect market maker hedging to kick off a subsequent short squeeze so i should sell im not saying that you just need to come up with a new reason for your decision because i think the initial thesis has more or less been satisfied by this point here are some reasons you might decide to hold or buy 1 you think gamestop the company is undervalued at $350 2 you think squeezing shorts that got in between $250 and $350 is possible 3 you think there is money to be made on volatility over the coming weeks such as more gamma squeezing of market makers 4 you think the media coverage will lead to more fomo and you want to ride the momentum 5 you think my reasoning is bullshit and the $20 shorts didnt actually cover yet and are about to be liquidated 6 you like the stock you want to be a longterm gamestop shareholder own part of the company take part in proxy votes etc and benefit from longterm growth of the business 7 you want to make a moral statement about hedge funds market makers brokers and the dirty pool they play if any of that rings true to you then take out a second mortgage on your house and buy that shit dont do that actually yes do that

708,137,2021-01-30 03:37:42,why the short squeeze cannot go on forever i have seen posts about shortsellers why do they need to close their position cant they hold out until the price goes down they can indeed do that but they have to pay to borrow those shares and i got curious what are they paying to not close so i looked it up and thought i would share i found this short faq on selling short shares providing rough calculations based on the current price of gme i found a rate of 32 on gme short borrow fee rate and i am lazy and assuming 60 million shares of being shorted every day 60000000 shares x $300share $18 billion dollars are being borrowed for shorting $18 billion 32 360 days in year $16 million dollars a day trading day or not roughly they are losing $300 million a month also the money that they have tied to margin on the short cannot be used elsewhere if they could have been making 5 somewhere else they are effectively paying 37 to short gme stock so you say when will the squeeze happen the better question is why the squeeze will happen at some point these hedge funds are going to need that money for something else they are losing 300 million a month that is assuming the price does not go up if it goes up any more they are losing more on interest the amount they pay in interest is calculated daily the other problem for them is what happens when they cannot borrow shares anymore if i decide i want to sell and the brokerage has to get the stock back from the shortseller the shortseller has to go to the market and buy for whatever price is available in a way as a stock owner you can set your own price if the liquidity in the market disappears you can set your price to be $1000 and they have to pay it to give your stock back holding the stock you are squeezing hedge funds and market makers for as long as there is no liquidity for gme stock

347,34,2021-01-30 05:02:14,jan 29 updated short interest the shorts arent out see tweet from s3 which has been unbiased so far and really great through all of this they cheated yesterday and could only get down to 113 of float the 53 refers to short interest including synthetic long shares which are created during shorting edit you tards are stupider than i thought shares shorted has dropped from 62m to 58m the si ft including synthetic float is a calculation too advanced for your smooth brains this explains all the short ladder attacks sudden price drops bc theyre trying to rattle paper hands the only way to lose is to sell also buy shares with cash not on margin based on what we saw yesterday and a stop loss means youll be hunted i personally have a number in my head that cant be front run smooooooth brain moves not a financial advisor i just really like the stock long gme shares 
971,140,2021-01-30 05:01:20,hold on to your coconuts an analogy of gme bear raids for idiots  you live on and island with 11 coconuts gme shares no one likes them as much as you there are 2 other douches melvie and his friend hedgy melvie promised the baddest motherfucker on the island hed give him 14 coconuts 139 short interest im the meantime you gathered up 10 coconuts into a bag melvin wants your coconuts bad or else that mean motherfucker he promised them to will bash his brains in then throw half his body into a volcano and feed the other half to a shark so melvin and hedgy want to buy your coconuts from you it cost you $1 a coconut to get them heres the bear raid so melvin and hedgy pass the one they have back and forth and say here have this for 90 cents then no you take it for 80 cents all the way down to a penny then they turn to look at you fear in their eyes and piss in their pants and say see these are only worth a penny praying desperately to whatever god they believe in that youll buy it are you buying that shit no because you arent a sucker and you have diamond hands and you know you can charge whatever the fuck you want for those things or else melvie is done for thats the bear raid thats it its the last price it traded for on low volume dont believe it its the only trick they have and it used to work but not anymore now that millions of us can communicate and know whats going on they think we are so fucking stupid short interest is still over 100 today but you know for a fucking fact they have to deliver shorting costs money margin interest isnt free and margin gets called and puts expire worthless holding your hairy coconuts is free all you have to do is nothing and they will bleed money until they are forced to pay whatever you want or they go bust dont sell your coconuts
0,73,2021-01-30 23:41:25,retail investors are being setup to take the fall wrote this as a comment initially but thought it would be better as post while being in the zeitgeist is fun i honestly dont see any good coming from the increased attention wall st and the financial media are trying hard and succeeding to a large extent at making this about retail investors gambling to take down the gme shorts lost in the noise is the fact that hedge funds acted irresponsibly with seemingly no risk management to create the conditions necessary for this chamath mentioned it briefly on cnbc and they promptly tried their best to take down the video theres very likely a lot of big money long gme trying to squeeze out the shorts as well with retail investors playing a very small role citadel and point72 used this to get a revenue sharing deal with melvin capital michael burry who went long on gme last year arguably in part due to the short has been trying hard to distance himself from the situation and theres barely any mention of him in the media i think some hedge funds are going for the kill and retail investors specifically this sub are being setup to take the fall in case this blows up the wider market edit im not asking anyone to sell gme the post is just about discussing the wider implications of whats happening as it relates to this sub
1033,117,2021-01-30 05:16:48,next week we come back full force in different brokerages thats not robinhood we need more volume for those of you who got cut off from buying gme by robinhood i hope you all switched out yesterday and made a new brokerage account that wont get corrupted by hedge funds i use fidelity and experience no issues due to this restriction on rh volume has been low next week we need all of you to start using your new brokerage do not be intimidated by today the days not over this isnt over hold do not sell edit dont transfer over shares just open up a new brokerage account and put in more buying power leave your existing shares in robinhood for now and ditch it after the short squeeze ends
3987,253,2021-01-30 06:05:44,urgent be on guard for them to flash crash gme at 359 to lower the price weve observed how much theyve manipulated markets be on guard for them to try to flash crash gme at 359 i recently read that rh was restricting sales to 1 share and the uk broker turning off buys this seems to a tactic to silo off buys rh will likely turn off all buys soon im concerned that they may plan to flash crash it at 359pm if youve considered buying in consider buying setting a limit order at 345pm est so if you dont have a rh account put in a limit order at 345pm to buy 1 or more share at a price youre comfortable with if you want this will provide a huge bid wall in front of the them in case the pummel the order flow with low asks edit from note1 i would argue that it would be better to set a limit order around 345pm in case they try to do a halt see note if this was informative tell 2 friends and tell them to tell 2 friends pass it on note just wanted to add to your post that like yesterday they may try the flash crash 5 min before end the volatility halt will kick in as it did yesterday at 155941 so we had no chance of getting it up in those last 19 seconds if they are hovering 10 above 115 150 200 with ten min to go we know that will be their plan and 15501554 will be crucial to get out of the 10 trap disclaimer im not a financial advisor im just a retard do what makes you feel comfortable
38,68,2021-01-31 02:13:09,just a thought for those who cannot buy gme because too expensive and if a star can help since gme has raise up to $300 most people cant afford few shares instead they buy fractional shares however rh and other broker fked them over last week im asking if there is any reputable star meet kevin grahnm linus mr beast etc to creat a donation fund for gme for all those that want to donate to the cause the gain or whatever comes out of it will goes to some charity or split between charity $5 might not seem much but if you pile everyone money together it can go a long way please tweet or pm these guys to see if they can help those what i just wrote just my thought im not a financial advisor and i really like the stock
438,94,2021-01-30 06:25:35,there cant be another gme michael burry  there cant be another gme just look at the short interest theres still not enough volume for the shorts to have covered also the calls that are in the money will have to have shares bought from the market today monday or tuesday so were in for a good ride think the shorts are realising theyre fucked and are covering this is just speculation but i think im fucking good godspeed to buyers sellers and holders wherever you are dont feel pressured to hold or sell i like the stonk i also like the movie 300 x200b 
74663,4110,2021-01-30 06:17:25,how to buy gme above broker limits how to buy gme etc loophole robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2 5 or very low numbers of gme however they are allowing option contracts heres a trick that will work 1 go to feb 5 option 2 scroll all the way down the call list 3 buy gme call option with the cheapest xxx 4 immediately exercise i just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares blocking the shorts you can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot best of luck out there lets get them ps if you can afford 100 shares but cant afford the risk you can sell heh some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table _this is not financial advice and is for informational purposes only you can lose 100 of anything you invest_ edit 1 this works for pretty much any stock 2 theres a catch you need enough money please dont use margin to cover 100 shares the way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price example $gme is $300 the 25 $50c is $250 so it costs $25000 cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 $5000 total cost $30000 same as buying 100 shares you could then sell shares at open market and derisk if you like and hold the remainder
727,78,2021-01-30 06:17:05,robinhood is a crucial element in this battle dont let them off the hook why because its the platform that the majority of people use to trade gme in my earlier post i explained the psychology of why the additional steps needed to find a new broker is unattractive to most new investors by making it harder to buy shares less people will go out of their way to buy them retail investing is strong because of robinhood its the ease and simplicity that attracts people the familiarity and social proof from seeing screenshot after screen shot helps too names like fidelity and vanguard are slightly more intimidating and perceivably more complex when in actuality they are not although the ui less beginner friendly imo just moments ago i noticed robinhood switched the 5 shares limit down to 1 meaning if you own more than 1 share of gme you cannot buy anymore thus continuing to remove buying pressure if robinhood were to remove all buying restrictions it would enable millions of potential pent up buyers who are simply too for lack of a better word lazy to switch brokers the volume has been much lower since rhs buying restrictions 170m every day from 122126 while today less than 40m so far we seemed to have let rh off the hook after their announcement stating that buying is turned back on when in fact it is not well unless you have 0 shares you can buy 1 for now we need to continue to fight to get the buying restrictions on robinhood lifted sure you can yell at people to switch brokers but i dont think it will have nearly as big an impact as getting the restriction lifted on rh even with the heavy selling pressures the hold is strong which is incredible i am still holding too until the restriction is lifted if you have a great broker that is reliable and easy to use please drop it in the comments below for people to see i use td ameritrade

1270,387,2021-01-30 06:53:02, gme 65 million shares outstanding 6 million users 115 shares per user  i dont want to write anything too long since english is not my native language and honestly i can read and understand fine but grammar is not my thing being that said let me play with some theoretic numbers check this out x200b gme has only about 65 million shares available in the market freefloat that means you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like cfds but theres a real scarcity on the main asset in this case the stock x200b we are about 6 million users here this means that if each user buys 10 stocks of gme more than the 85 of the free float shares are going to be assigned and in this case its going to create a problem for closing shortselling positions since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade remember scarcity is the word here x200b dont you know what this means im not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the orderbook but do the mental math wall street bets won we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end and this is a victory for retail traders if we want we could sweep the market x200b remember that goerge soros did something similar to the gbp if you pressure enough the market you are going to find out where it lacks liquidity x200b i raise my glass for you cheers
9,1,2021-01-31 03:51:15,you need to hold gme because this isnt just a fight between wall st and wsb it involves the entire world and theres a trump card on our side listen up you tards somebody predicted here that if the gme squeeze happens at these prices and numbers it would explode so violently the ripple effects itd have on wall st would completely destroy the us economy do you know who americas biggest enemy is if you thought china youre retarded theyre just in the spotlight often because theyre poised to overtake the usa technologically and economically sometime in the future so usa wants to make them look as bad as possible to the general public no their biggest actual enemy is russia by far cold war using other countries to conduct proxy wars constant hacking from russia putin controlling trump and making him his puppet wtf is that shit do you know who the richest person in the world is if you answered bezos youre retarded if you answered elon youre even more retarded if you answered deepfuckinvalue youre a simp but thats okay because i simp for him too no the richest person is a man that owns an entire country has dozens of other rich people give him 50 of their money and has his staff regularly wear watches worth over half a million fucking dollars that man is vladimir putin look if that tard was correct that this squeeze might destroy the us economy putin will throw down a few billion to lock up all outstanding float buy up shit loads of otm calls all up the options chain and blast the stock price to the fucking moon im sure hes in the process of figuring out how to move a few billion to buy all these securities without it being traced back to him which sounds like it would take a while after this happens well all become fucking billionaires even if you bought 10 shares at 300 and thank and love putin and the russian government so much that cnbc will use that as proof of us being trump supporters tldr putin likes the stock this is not financial advice i am not a licensed financial professional i am uneducated on this topic and am not responsible if putin obliterates the us economy

421,142,2021-01-30 07:00:53,amd restrictions okay i just wanna point this out again im pretty sure this has been posted before but this thing is ridiculous amd beat their earnings this tuesday 2601 many analysts are upgrading their price targets for amd source many catalysts are coming short interest is vastly increasing over the past months source each morning amd spikes up and after that it gets beaten down and it is bleeding till close it felt like there was a manipulation going but now with gme bb nok surging we finally see that amd is being manipulated as hell robinhood is restricting the amount of shares u can buy to a number of one share source amd hasnt had a significant bullrun like the onces mentioned before but u clearly see that wallstreet is scared of a potential move coming they have been dragging us down for a while now and it is holding back the potential growth a company can make i am glad the gme move has revealed the underlying system whereby the rich are getting richer by dragging down companies i hope we wont give up and i pray for more tears from billionaires to come
1,1,2021-01-31 04:23:02,i might make 150usd a month but im holding gme tiny reinforcement from asia and a story of how unfair things have been for me and others this is gonna be a long story about all the unfairness i observed and endured from the 1 both in corporate and the market im sorry if it bores you i saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and i wanted to share my own sorry for my bad english hello wsb i last post around half a year ago on how the us stock market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150usd a month i got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which i immensely appreciated now that the gme phenomenon has spreaded over the globe even here although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like i went through more below so to recap i saved up 2000 usd ever since i was young uptil now im 21 now working ever since i was in elementary school money was all i had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling backstory ive always loved pc and paid close attention to it so when their new ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and i got to test them out while working part time i took a look at their stock it was trading at around 2 i think so with my excitement i was eager to join the market i asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was the market is rigged dont join it i was stumbed he lost a lot in 2008 maybe that was why so after a month of research it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the us market or actually to any market aside our own our banks wouldnt even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable but heres the thing the hedge funds here can that was the first unfair thing i witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life in the end i couldnt find a way to get in and watched as amd make it meteoric rise over the past few years it was really depressing thinking back on how the profit couldve helped my family fast forward to 2020 i finally found a way to make a foreign account with td and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account i just need to send him money through epayment the fees was high not to mention since we cant use ach because were transferring to td from his account it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 usd for the money to land in my account but after all that i managed to get into the market i grinded through all the courses on td and read all the posts from various subs but life is never that smooth around that time i saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition that inspired me i wanted to do that so badly first for my brother the beer virus crash i joined the market at feb 28th 2020 yes right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses i almost lost it all i switched between puts and calls as i see fit but in the end i came out with 200usd left i thought i was the unluckiest guy on earth it was tiring since were on opposite end of the timezone i usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am all that and ending up with huge loss was devastating thinking back i shouldve pulled out when i was seeing my money losing everyday the corona started affecting our country we did a great job at handling it but i can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs i put myself back together and get back in with my 200 slowly grinding up back to 2000 it was arduous but when i finally got back to breakeven it felt amazing because im not starting again im starting again with experience sadly by this time my father lost his job due to corporate politicsdirtyplay i wont get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others its been going on for years in the end he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to keep the image of the company and guess what he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews we both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one they would he put off to them its much better to scapegoat one person than to say we let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything after all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try it was going well we dont have advance options and we also dont allow legal shorting here but as well soon find out its only a rule for us commoners basically shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short ive witness quite a few short ladder attack and since we dont have options we dont have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but i am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them you can tell by this point i have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits gme and the global movement and that brings us to this unprecedented time i didnt get into gme soon enough 4 gme shares at 150 cost basis my money was tired up in spreade for bb and nok expiring last friday which was rather deep itm i had bb 2122c and bb hit a peak of 28 last week and as we all know by abusing their power yet again they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless but i held gme i held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me so now all i have is 4 gme shares that i will hold until we can get back at them and when not if we win hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this a lot of people i know are asking to join and ive been helping them setting up accounts on tda or etoro etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck since there are no way for us to get fractional shares etoro been wonky some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of gme on monday i look forward to the day we win this so many things are on the line not just for our generation but our previous and future generations not just for the us stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world in the end we might win the battle of gme but still not win much from this war of unfairness but thats a start so to conclude this stupid long tedtalk you have reinforcement from everywhere wsb even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share lets make them pay for what they took from us and if possible my brother tuition also 10k per share is not a meme tldr poor kid from 3rd world country holding gme because suits treated his family badly position every penny in my name 4 shares of gme buy and hold gme this is not financial advices

here although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like i went through more below so to recap i saved up 2000 usd ever since i was young uptil now im 21 now working ever since i was in elementary school money was all i had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling backstory ive always loved pc and paid close attention to it so when their new ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and i got to test them out while working part time i took a look at their stock it was trading at around 2 i think so with my excitement i was eager to join the market i asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was the market is rigged dont join it i was stumbed he lost a lot in 2008 maybe that was why so after a month of research it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the us market or actually to any market aside our own our banks wouldnt even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable but heres the thing the hedge funds here can that was the first unfair thing i witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life in the end i couldnt find a way to get in and watched as amd make it meteoric rise over the past few years it was really depressing thinking back on how the profit couldve helped my family fast forward to 2020 i finally found a way to make a foreign account with td and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account i just need to send him money through epayment the fees was high not to mention since we cant use ach because were transferring to td from his account it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 usd for the money to land in my account but after all that i managed to get into the market i grinded through all the courses on td and read all the posts from various subs but life is never that smooth around that time i saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition that inspired me i wanted to do that so badly first for my brother the beer virus crash i joined the market at feb 28th 2020 yes right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses i almost lost it all i switched between puts and calls as i see fit but in the end i came out with 200usd left i thought i was the unluckiest guy on earth it was tiring since were on opposite end of the timezone i usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am all that and ending up with huge loss was devastating thinking back i shouldve pulled out when i was seeing my money losing everyday the corona started affecting our country we did a great job at handling it but i can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs i put myself back together and get back in with my 200 slowly grinding up back to 2000 it was arduous but when i finally got back to breakeven it felt amazing because im not starting again im starting again with experience sadly by this time my father lost his job due to corporate politicsdirtyplay i wont get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others its been going on for years in the end he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to keep the image of the company and guess what he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews we both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one they would he put off to them its much better to scapegoat one person than to say we let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything after all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try it was going well we dont have advance options and we also dont allow legal shorting here but as well soon find out its only a rule for us commoners basically shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short ive witness quite a few short ladder attack and since we dont have options we dont have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but i am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them you can tell by this point i have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits gme and the global movement and that brings us to this unprecedented time i didnt get into gme soon enough 4 gme shares at 150 cost basis my money was tired up in spreade for bb and nok expiring last friday which was rather deep itm i had bb 2122c and bb hit a peak of 28 last week and as we all know by abusing their power yet again they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless but i held gme i held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me so now all i have is 4 gme shares that i will hold until we can get back at them and when not if we win hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this a lot of people i know are asking to join and ive been helping them setting up accounts on tda or etoro etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck since there are no way for us to get fractional shares etoro been wonky some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of gme on monday i look forward to the day we win this so many things are on the line not just for our generation but our previous and future generations not just for the us stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world in the end we might win the battle of gme but still not win much from this war of unfairness but thats a start so to conclude this stupid long tedtalk you have reinforcement from everywhere wsb even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share lets make them pay for what they took from us and if possible my brother tuition also 10k per share is not a meme tldr poor kid from 3rd world country holding gme because suits treated his family badly position every penny in my name 4 shares of gme buy and hold gme this is not financial advices

79,55,2021-01-31 02:53:05,discussion diamond hands fund what if there were a way to encourage people to have many cryptocurrency models now have the ability to delegate control of an asset for a period of time what if there was a way of locking up gme shares into some sort of delegated fund or pool is there some sort of fiduciary that we could send money too in order to allow them to buy and hold gme for a period of time like a year or more being able to demonstrate that a certain potential number of shares were effectively out of play for a year or more would send a big message id delegate a share for a year
172,93,2021-01-31 04:31:05,bb closes on friday cheap due to profit taking and rh restricting buying bb shares bb has dropped from a high of 28 down to 14 gme has been dominating this sub lately and for good reason but if you havent read about bb check out some previous posts like these ones this is more a long term play but i would guess that it will bounce back up in the short term also do consider that eventually gme will squeeze or burn and i think bb will be a stock that many here will flock to it has huge potential and is similar to gme in that they are in the process of changing their business model around and have new deals and huge potential this is not financial advice invest at your own discretion 3000 shares bb
2,2,2021-01-31 05:34:54,gme is actually criminally undervalued and is poised to be the next trillion dollar company mods please dont delete hear me out tldr gamestops longterm success is not a meme they are actually poised to be the next trilliondollar company they are still highly undervalued despite the risk long rant i am not a financial advisor im just a simple ape that wants a better future for us all i started investing in my early 20s back in 2011 ive actually avoided wallstreetbets for a long time because yolo and loss porn were never my cup of tea but somewhere along the way you all grew up you found out the difference between gambling and investing you see ive always been of the opinion that any type of shortterm strategy is gambling when it comes to buying or selling stock markets are susceptible to wild fluctuation and you are a fool if you think you can time the market for a perfect quick flip ive avoided options and have never taken a short position because i understand just how risky they can be exposing yourself to potentially unlimited losses is something only the stupidest people are willing to do and they do not deserve to call themselves investors to be an investor there is only one true strategy and that is buy and hold i remember back in 2012 i read an article about a littleknown company at the time called tesla motors they had just announced their model s and i really liked that company so i bought some shares which at the time cost my $27 each i held those shares and i waited until model s deliveries started arriving on doorsteps i waited until charging stations cropped up all over the country i waited until they announced gigafactories and energy storage and in 2015 i sold my shares for about $270 per share i remember bragging about my gains at the time like a paper handed little bitch i dont brag about that anymore if i would have held on to those shares my life would be in a completely different place now financially this was one of the hardest lessons ive ever learned as an investor and i dont intend on making it again enough about me let me tell you why gme is the next trilliondollar company and why im holding my measly 15 shares at $298 until i pass them down to my daughter in my will first let me talk about the power of a brand by looking at a company like apple in 2001 apple was also at an all time low considered to be a failing company at the time they released a new mp3 layer called the ipod which gained them tremendous appeal amongst a younger generation of customers since then apple has spent billions of dollars per year in marketing and product placements to maintain mass appeal for their brand among young people which are the most difficult demographic to market to apple today is worth $2 trillion dollars as a company and you know what i dont like apple they make overpriced hardware and with overly restrictive software and use subliminal brainwashing tactics to trick you into buying their crappy products but gamestop i really like gamestop heres why gamestop much like apple in 2001 doesnt look like much on paper but none of that matters because without spending a single dollar overnight gme has become the most beloved brand among younger people that is incredibly powerful never before have so many individuals been this enthusiastically invested in the longterm success of any company gamestop has gotten massive amounts of free pr and had undying loyalty from millions of individuals that are not only investors but customers as well this whole movement is being driven by gamestops loyal customer base this is monumental if i were gamestops ceo i would be so giddy right now their company has been adopted by the wsb community it is our child i would never sell my child there is no price high enough to sacrifice my own children gamestop is poised for a very bright future because there isnt a single new product or pivot that this loyal undying customer and investor base wont be on board with new streaming service esports league eggs i dont care im buying it i keep hearing all this bullshit from boomers who think they are experts and they keep saying gamestop isnt worth their current price this is bullshit they are lying to put fear into you gamestop is actually worth so much more $1000 per share is not a meme $10000 per share is not a meme in twenty years gamestop will be worth more than apple google and amazon combined why because it is our company not their company we just bought it its ours and we will make sure it is the best one do not be a paper handed fool that falls for all the bullshit fear from media sources and idiots who are in the pockets of hedge funds and short term gamblers thats all they are morons who wouldve bet against apple in 2001 diamond hands is not a meme either it is the simplest and most legitimate form of investing buying a stock that you like and holding it until you retire is exactly how you become a millionaire its a strategy thats good enough for warren buffet and its good enough for us think of all the paper handed pussies that sold apple in 2001 is that what you want this to be the time you made a small buck quickly and missed out on true longterm wealth as far as im concerned there is only one thing that gme can do to mess this up and that is to turn against us dont dilute shares dont bail out the short sellers that were so eager to shutter your doors and ruin your business we believe in you and will support you so dont let us down as long as gamestop is loyal to us the investors their future is very bright any industry or pivot they would like to pursue is immediately theirs because they have our undying support amazon google apple i dont like them but gamestop i really really like them a lot i dont want a gmail any more let me get a gamestop mail i dont want prime any more i want gamestop i dont want an iphone i want gamestop diamond emoji hands emoji rocket emoji moon emoji 
55,59,2021-01-31 05:26:37,market cap weighted etfs will be forced to buy gme soon my theory is that shorts arent going to give up expecting a dump next week then next week then next week it doesnt happen at this point months have gone on gme no longer rises 100 a day but is much higher than it is now algo bots have at this point classified the stock as trading with high valuation they buy the dips people still refuse to sell shorts havent given up thinking any dip is a good time to short could really see this happening not concerned about it dumping anytime soon if it does its probably mm shorting the entire float again
42,30,2021-01-31 05:11:40,know whos on the other side of your trade i find the following to be very interesting first let me confess that i sold a percentage of my shares but let me tell you why i bought in at $40 sold and bought back in at $97 and again at $140 thursday afternoon my girlfriend comes home from work and tells me that after three years of trying shes pregnant im going to be a dad im absolutely shook with excitement and the rest of the day was us just talking about it bedtime comes around and im laying awake thinking diapers are fucking expensive and 3k buys a lot of diapers i need my original investment back but what is my plan i set a sell order at 40997 for 8 shares the amount of my original investment i pick that number because well its not 42069 and i know there are a ton of retards with sell orders at that price i needed something well below that and 8 shares at 40997 just happened to coincide perfectly with my original investment the next morning i wake up to a massive spike premarket and i know i got a chance the market opens and for the first minute the stock shot up and at 931 est my sell order for 8 shares at 40997 was completed i had back my original investment and everything going forward is now a free ride the stock briefly touches 41300 and you can look at the charts to know what happened next this morning im reading a post here on wsb and i see a post from a guy saying that he bought at 409 and im thinking the stock has only touched that price 4 times what if i read a few of his posts and learn that he bought 8 shares at 409 so i asked him if he bought them at at 931 est and he replied in the affirmative i asked him was the price actually 40997 and again affirmative i realize that yes this is most likely the other side of my trade a fucking retard just like me what does this mean it means that melvin capital is likely not buying our shares at 409 that much i can gather but what else could it tell us the odds of finding the other side of my trade on wsb are probably astronomical considering how many shares were traded that day so im blown away by that possibility but id love some smart people to weigh in on the odds of that occurrence and what else it might possibly tell us you can check my post history to see the interaction i may provide further proof if anyone is interested edit i didnt even mention im talking about gme sorry
297,68,2021-01-31 03:17:22,dont get blinded by rage hello my fellow tards old and new increasingly weve been seeing posts and comments from redditors who have purchased gme and similar shorted positions with a primary interest in exacting revenge against the billionaire hedge funds thats all good and fine i totally resonate with that message and honestly fuck em they set the rules in their favour and are now upset that weve found a way to exploit it that said ive also seen people taking incredible financial risks and selfdestructive behaviour in the interest of sticking it to the man we may be retarded but dont be fucking stupid at the end of the day these big fish are gonna lose a couple billion that they manage for others cry a little and then go home to their mansions yachts jets mailorder brides and their boyfriends etc if anything theyll go to congress and set the rules even more squarely in their favour wanna know how we can exact revenge against the system learn it use it get rich yourself then if you so wish change the system however you please dont go broke for this i guarantee you were annoying as fuck to them but at the end of the day theyre still going to be better off than any of us gme to fucking andromeda positions $8000 in gme shares which ill hold til my hands fucking crystallize obligatory mods are gay and we love you dont fucking delete this tldr get rich not poor ps to any boomer from cnbc reading this omfg the highlight of my week has been watching a bunch of fucking millennial retards with a phone make you reeeeeee on national tv

485,222,2021-01-30 20:43:47,can the government force melvin and fucks alike to cover why not i know the system is rigged and they all pay bribes to each other suits politicians media but even letting my bias aside isnt it in everyones best interest to force the shorts to cover 1 hedge funds dont create value they can die if they go bankrupt who fucking cares they dont create any value they just bet on companies and in some cases drive them out of business for the sole purpose of making money wether you believe in gamestops fundamentals and financials or not there was no reason for its stock to be at $4 dollars and ultimately put 14000 people out of their job ever even on a personal level all those suits have money set aside in tax havens im certainly not worried about them we still wont ever get close to 1 of their net worth 2 hf are taking everyone down looking at this weeks events theyre basically fucking everyone over theyre fucking the brokers who are out of liquidity because of financial requirements therefore have to limit trading etc the clearinghouses who have to protect themselves by asking for 100 of collateral on those trade which impacts the brokers us ultimately the banks and they are tanking the market by closing large positions in baba spy whatever just to stay afloat 3 only wall street isnt on our side who is against us only the crooks no one else is saying yeah 140 short is perfectly normal it shouldnt be illegal they need to be saved the world is watching all the peasants on the planet want to make them pay politicians from all parties agree were backed up by celebrities and the likes honestly ive even read some decent articles 4 2008 pandemic biden do i need to remind anyone about 2008 do i need to remind anyone were in the middle of a pandemic people are out of jobs businesses are closing healthcare workers are overworked biden just took office does he want to fuck himself over in his first week and he wont go for a second mandate so he might as well take them out all in all given todays situation i want to believe that the government cant leave the retail investors hold the bags after this is over i cant imagine the repercussions this would have if we are betrayed by everyone and the scumbags get bailed out billions given the current state of the economy it is also a truly unique opportunity knowing 2008 precedents to finally put them against their crimes and improve the system one more thing institutions own 70 of gme lets say everyone is on our side stars are aligned institutions like hf dont care about us and probably dont care either about taking down other hf they have the upper hand what hand are they playing tldr melvin and co should die they dont create value its a domino effect because they dont want to cover theyre taking down the brokers clearinghouses the market us ultimately the banks the world is watching everyone is on our side but them 2008 memories pandemic distressed population and economy biden has been in office for 1 week isnt it in everyones best interest that they dont get bailed out and that we arent left bag holding however institutions including hf own 70 of gamestop even if it all goes well we could still be fucked over what hand are they playing edit i even want to add blm to general public sentiment wether you agree or not we are apolitical redistribution of wealth and to some extent positive repercussions for charities and the economy
277,298,2021-01-30 20:04:13,whats to stop them from doing ladder drops and buying cheap shares to cover their stock like they did the past 2 days from what ive gathered the reason why the price for gme didnt shoot up to ath on friday is because the hedge were limiting ppls ability to buy more shares and then constantly selling shares to each other at lower prices to drive the price down then buying shares from people that paper handed their shares of gme they also bought calls that expired on friday to profit when the stock went back up whats to stop the hedge funds from continuing this strategy until they drive the price down enough and get enough profit from calls fds so that a squeeze wont happen i dont think the sec really cares about retail investors and congress is all talk and no action i feel like the game is rigged theyre gonna find a way to get out of this unscathed 15k in gme shares ive held hundreds of calls that expired worthless i have no problem holding shares that have no expiration date id rather see gme drop to zero than let the hedge fund guys win

221,202,2021-01-30 18:33:56,gme short interest wwmd what would melvin do ask yourself what would you do if you were in melvins shoes would you give up and capitulate to a bunch of mouth breathing basement dwellers or fight back so what do we know we know that the media is spinning the narrative that melvin closed its position does this mean they exited their short maybe maybe not given the current short interest over 100 by most sources maybe even 250 by others and the consensus that they did not have time to fully exit the position when they said they did one conclusion is that their position was not exited but still remains is it possible that their pride would not allow them to be defeated and they pledged assigned or otherwise sold their position via derivative or other structured offering to a trusted third party to give the illusion that they exited thus causing wsb and other longs to sell off there are two citadels citadel the hedge fund hf cohen and citadel securities mm we know that citadel securities pays robinhood and others for our order flow using this data they are in the best possible position to see when sentiment is on the sell side for citadel hfs newly acquired melvin short position of course it is absurd to think that these two citadels dont interact or share data because there is a chinese wall between them time to take a tequila shot we also know that cohen via citadel hf loaned or invested nearly 3 billion to melvin as a lifeline what we dont know is how this money was allocated or for what purpose one theory is that melvin used the money to purchase calls of various strikes and expiry on gme to hedge its losses there is another post about this topic this seems unlikely for several reasons better explained in that post another theory is this 3 billion was the magical number to close its position unverified so lets assume for now its not accurate given the hubris and big dick swinging energy of these funds another alternative is that they wanted their cake and to fucking eat it too ask yourself what is more likely they 1exit and go quietly accepting their losses to a bunch of independent amateurs riding the short bus or 2 be the greedy af as history has shown time and time again perhaps they didnt close the position but assigned it to citadel hf which is well capitalized possibly even with the caveat of buying it back they then use the citadel capital infusion to load up on gme shorts right before citadel securities via robinhood restricted trading capital could also be used to gobble up shares when gme went into freefall with those calculated ladder attacks or when gme shareholders were stopped out citadel hf then rides the existing melvin short position down to the ground profiting on that trade as wsb and other longs capitulate due to restrictions and other fuckery tldr melvin capital is still a part of the short interest and has not closed its position not financial advice allegedly these things happened in a fairy tale positions gme multiple feb call options and shares 370 please come get me

141,185,2021-01-30 16:53:57,wsb i found something retarded that cannot be true explain to me what i am not seeing gme options so i went digging through leaps for gme cause i am retarded x200b i noticed the premium for selling a call way out say january 2023 is 3205 on the $2 strike so now shares of gme are 312 so in theory if i took my $31200 and bought 100 shares and sold the $2 call even if i just met the ask i get 320 premium so my 31200 becomes 32000 and eventually 32200 after the call expires and i get an extra 200 but essentially i turned 31200 into 32000 with no effort so 800 per contract sold obviously volume is low but say i could do this 200x which according to asks its 3205 thats 850 profit per contract 3205031200 so now i can take my 32050 and do the same and eventually after 36th one sold i can then start selling 2 etc and after my 200th which takes up all the volume for the ones that profit an average of 850 i have an extra $170000 obviously this cannot be correct what am i missing x200b tldr x200b buy a stock for 31200 sell a covered call and get 32050 thats a profit of 850 rinse and repeat until you have sold to all the asks over the share price 200x not only are 20000 shares locked up for a bit in long term options but you have gained 850 profit 200x which is 170k x200b what am i missing where does this go south x200b edit the answer is i forgot to account for the fact gme closed at 324 and the bid is 320 so you would lose 400 per trade now if it followed the meeting in the middle of the bid ask spread then it would be a 150 profit per trade but only 76 of those exist thanks uboblawslawblawg x200b edit 2 corrected username dont drink a single yuengling before diving into the internet and by single ipa i mean if you crack a new one before the other one is empty its still just 1 and by crack a new one i mean case

447,76,2021-01-30 16:22:55,for everyone that has their brokerage at fidelity if you have margin on your account they will lend your shares i highly suggest removing margin for now i have a fidelity account and ive had it for some time i have margin on my account because i planned to get into options but i never did i never even ran up a margin balance i noticed recently that even though i had bought 95 of my gme shares cash they were showing as margin this means that fidelity is loaning your shares i contacted customer service and asked them to move my shares from margin to cash they said they could do that but they would just move back to margin as fidelity loans shares for anyone that has a margin account i highly recommend that anyone with a margin account at fidelity contact customer service and disable margin on their account do not let them lend your shares mark cuban just tweeted about this if wsb recalls their shares from lending en mass it can help the short squeeze gme

1290,473,2021-01-30 14:59:14,were all in a really good spot with gamestop heres what ive been seeing these last couple of days that gives me a lot of hope that the squeeze on gme is working aside from media and billionaires freaking out which gives me confidence that this is real lets take a look at some other examples at the beginning of this week we were looking at volumes close to 150200m that volume obviously took a hit yesterday when many brokers decided to stop allowing purchases but even today the trading volume was relatively low additionally the stock price has continued to increase all of these days indicating that there are more shares bought than sold the price is around $315 and most people still arent selling indicated by the low volume today friday that means this price will likely hold as a baseline since we keep taking more shares away from the float and are holding onto it this has become a movement though and more and more people are willing to purchase a ticket to stick it to wall street you think fewer people are going to get involvedhell no more people want in on this with those from canada australia uk germany and across the world getting in on this if people keep buying more shares and holding there will be fewer shares available for trading and well likely see even less volume in the days ahead how do we know theyll holdwell most of those getting in now are doing so to stick it to wall street so they dont mind losing some money if it comes to it most importantly this means they will hold plus a smaller accessible float means the price will rise or at least stay stable neither of which is sustainable for hedge funds this does not end well for them in any way the squeeze may not happen immediately but as the number of available shares decreases the probability for an imminent squeeze gets better since the hedge funds will be margin called and have to buy to cover in fact the longer this goes on the more epic the squeeze becomes at this point theyre still short 100 and the number of float available becomes less and less everyday as more people buy and hold its really only a matter of timeso keep the faith

0,88,2021-01-30 14:21:48,suggestion to gme board members as a worst case scenario which will end in a winwin for the company all share holders while offering shorts an out so theres 50 million shares available right now and lets say 65 million are shorted what if gme offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldnt all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds what if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000 if hedge funds are forced to cover thats their out or for fun we could do it at 2000 or a range of prices the first million shares at 1000 the next at 1100 etc all current holders ryan cohen board members etc would get diluted but they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price example 50m shares at 300 are available right now they share 50m more at 1000 each each share gets diluted by half but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value essentially by selling the shares at 1000 each current share value goes up to $650 i dont know what im talking about if what im suggesting is stupid say so or get this to the top of wsb as a worst case trigger to pull x200b rockets rockets rockets diamond emoji hands prayer etc x200b edit everyone who holds gamestop would get paid out pretty decently the whole stock market doesnt go into turmoil hedge funds learn their hundreds of billions dollars lesson 
604,153,2021-01-30 14:17:34,important if the nyse announces a halt on trading on gme it will only hurt the shorts  im not a financial advisor but i did get in at $15 and more at $350 so thanks dfv and sja i hope you got back in on time i think we need to consider the possibility that the nyse might halt trading on gme to prevent further market irregularities this could happen as early as next week based off my extensive speculation but have no fear who would a 30 day halt on trading hurt the guys who are hemorrhaging billions so if news pops that the nyse is planning to halt you bet your ass this guy is holding every damn share i like the stock and fuck the hedge asswipes 
209,247,2021-01-30 14:00:34,what happens if rh users are prohibited from selling when the squeeze happens edit this thread is about robinhood in particular i know that not letting anybody sell across all platforms wouldnt be in citadels best in interest im talking about if only robinhood users arent able to sell ive made a ton of comments and posts about this with no real replies so i dont think theres any recourse whatsoever if this happens either rh shuts down completely pending investigation or they conveniently experience an outage while the squeeze is happening either way those of us with gme shares in rh cant sell when the squeeze happens cant transfer the stocks to another broker since that takes a week and by then the squeeze will likely be done and the price will come crashing down again and a lot of us dont have the spare cash laying around to just buy more shares at another broker and forget about the ones we have in rh its a serious concern and i think theres a near 100 possibility that they pull something like this as its their only move to stop people from making money on the squeeze those of us stuck with rh will be forced to watch our shares gain a ton of value not be able to sell then watch the price tank and theres not a damn thing we can do about it

143,119,2021-01-30 13:49:49,steve cohen owns the mets so i have a hunch that steve cohens going to be a little broke in the near future turnsout he owns 95 of the mets it was really important to him he went from owning 8 in 2013 to finally taking over controlling majority in november of 2020 so that means hes gotten to be majority owner of the mets for about 90 days isnt that nice the mets are worth $24 billion theres probably a better way to look this up but this has the basics making cohens piece $22 in order to take majority ownership one would need to purchase 48 of the mets from cohen andor the 5 holder family that owns the team 48 of 24 115 billion in theory that would be a fair price according to my smooth brain math so i think we should offer him $500 million cash for 48 of the mets with the option to buy more if the family turnsover their ownership to cohen $650m less than the smoothbrain value of his stake in the team but it would be an injection of $500m liquid capital which could help him buy gme shares from us right away i dont know how to run a fucking baseball team doubt any of you do either wait maybe dfv but we could flip the majority stake to idk jayz turn a little profit make a foundation for families that got burned during the 2008 housing crisis and frontline medical workers thoughts tldr ny mets majority owner in financial stress hostile wsb takeover imminent flip the majority ownership to someone for a profit

137,249,2021-01-30 13:09:29,a financial professionals best narrative of what happened in gme this week granted im only a back office accountant for an investment company but im financially literate and have been following this very closely heres my narrative of what took place this week melvin short squeeze bailout to understand the genesis of the bailout by point 72citadel its important to understand how ls hedge funds operate the customers that these businesses are competing for are their investors lps which consist of pension funds insurance companies and family offices etc these lps have their own portfolio managers who examine their investments periodically and might decide that they should invest in a ls hf for diversification purposes or some such reason the entire ls strategy competes amongst itself for these lp dollars all things being equal lps will invest in the funds that have the best historical returns this leads to a competitive landscape where ls funds only need to do better relative to each other rather than the overall market when you game theory this out it leads to these funds largely mirroring each others plays while doing things differently only to the extent they think they have an information advantage over their competitors this results in certain stocks having large numbers of funds as their investors both as longs and shorts the term for these companies on wall street is hedge fund hotels as reddit squeezed gamestop it increased the amount of money owed on melvins short which led them to sell longs in order to derisk and cover because they sold these long positions it had a contagion effect on hfs in the same space who held the same longs and therefore had losses as melvins selling pressure began to crush their funds because of this contagion effect steven cohen and citadel stepped in to bailout melvin not because he thought it was a good investment but to prevent an entire hedge fund strategy from imploding now its very important to consider how this $27b dollars was likely used by melvin for melvin to fight reddit by shorting gme would have been the institutional equivalent of a wsb yolo and likely would not have worked for them to use the $27b to buy stock and cover would have been very difficult as they would be directionally moving the same way as both retail and option dealers who were trying to delta hedge which would have spiked the price of the stock much further logically i think melvin used the money early this week to buy massive amounts of call options at a range of expiries and strikes this would allow them to derisk their toxic position economically while not continuing to spike the price of the shares as much as buying in the open this explains why the short interest of the stock didnt move much for most of this week the shares were still sold short but the squeeze wasnt as harmful to melvin as their mtm gains on the options could be used as collateral on the short position as they exercise options going forward they can cover their short this also explains cnbcs deception when they said melvin had closed the position notice they dont say covered their short as thats not true it also explains steven a cohens taunt of a tweet this week where he said bring it on it was almost as if to say weve bought our options were done here do what you want you fucking plebes understand that if what im saying turns out to be the case melvin got very special treatment from their prime brokers a broker would never let you use risky option positions as full collateral against a short to avoid a margin call understand also that if this is true the bad news is that the squeeze will never be squoze the way reddit thinks but the good news is that the stock will enjoy good price support for a while as melvin exercises their options and sucks up shares to cover the actual short tldr the squeeze wont quite be squoze
494,148,2021-01-30 13:08:21,gme insider quiet period v2 insider blackout means no sales thru earnings  reposting on request from utomatoehaven citron said in his video that a squeeze cant happen if insiders keep selling but insiders likely can not sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockupblackout period which usually extends until earnings are reported which is on 326 tldr no insider selling means more fuel because paper handed insiders cant give in to the shorts even if they wanted to alright listen up i did a quick search on wsb and didnt see any hits actually talking about what is known as a quiet period or blackout for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues gme stock you need to know this to understand one of the big points that citron made is complete bs in the short term insiders creating liquidity for shorts im assuming that many wsbers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many mostall companies impose on their insiders heres a quick education in that and a summary of what it might mean for gme obligatory disclaimer im not a financial advisor and i am long gme first what is stock based compensation this is exactly what it sounds like when as part of your comp for being a good employee you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached there are many different flavors of this that are important options these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price known as a strike price which may be significantly below than market value good there are many different types of option eg iso nq but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values these are common for preipo companies youll see these in the world of spacs for example as warrants rsu restricted stock units these are literally shares given almost like cash more common for post ipo companies prsu performance rsus usually tied to some job performance goal such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stockequity plan these are usually things like time vesting which simply means that you cant take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of monthsyears from the wallst perspective stock comp is reported as an expense so youll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time second how do companies ensure these incentives dont hurt them or other shareholders this is critically important besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not this is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy now when wsb usually thinks about insider trading you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash or pop and they should act accordingly yes thats insider trading however there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves to protect against that companies will often place quiet periods trading blackouts before the end of a quarter often by weeks at a time and extend that blackout through earnings report day read end of gme quarter is this month meaning it is incredibly likely that all gme issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout this is almost certainly why you dont see rc or anyone else from gme saying anything right now due to quiet period in practical terms gme would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants such as etrade which is common the stock admin at gme would communicate blackout dates to etrade in this example and during these dates all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled read gme insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now and can not sell because of corporate blackout this means the shorts cant cover with insider liquidity like citron said since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings and that is weeksmonth away those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders summary citron said short squeeze cant happen when insiders are selling insiders very likely cant sell because of end of quarter blackout this should be common knowledge for citron and other shorts anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp please do sanity check me here and im happy to edit and refine edit this is fuel since this means yet more of the outstanding shares that are inaccessible to cover shorts
1192,218,2021-01-30 12:53:27,gme big squeeze documentary my fellow autists and retards i am a senior film student at well known university in connecticut ivy league rhymes with whale for my senior film thesis i have been documenting the rise of this subreddit i started back in august when this sub was going all in on tesla fds but now things have taken a crazy turn clearly something massive is happening right now and it needs to be properly documented years from now some hollywood pansy is going to make this a movie and completely fuck up the real story dont yall want one of your own telling it my positions are 100 shares gme 3750 and 200 shares nok 406 for my project i humbly ask if any of you beautiful retards who have made bank off gme would be willing to let me interview you obviously id love the whale himself udeepfuckingvalue but id also want to interview anyone who has made a life changing amount of money can be any amount as long as it was big for you personally off gme i will of course publish my final project on this subreddit for all to see happy tendies lads 
415,124,2021-01-30 12:47:42,why gme fundamentals dont matter for gme stock because gme did not issue most gme stock a stock is a share of ownership in a company at this point gme is 250 shorted which means for every 100 shares issued by gme the company citadel has issued 150 shares so the gme stock is more of a share in ownership of citadel than a share of ownership of gme the question is not whether gamestop is a 20 billion dollar company the question is whether citadel can buy back 30 billion of shares and yes they can they are very liquid and have great pe ratio so the stock is undervalued from a fundamentals perspective

216,242,2021-01-30 12:28:22,who are the whales buying gme before i start full disclosure all of this is pure speculation out of the mind of a deranged autist with too much time and gme shares in his diamond hands dont use this as financial advice its prob all bs and will get you bankrupt ok for all my gme autists things have been rough this week but weve managed to pull through with that said i believe this was not just luck or sheer force of will i think there are hidden actors on our side or to the very least profiting from our chaos why here we go 1 retail has been severely handicapped through platforms this week and even with very few of us still active we managed to keep the price of gme above 320 2 during short attacks especially the last one this friday someone went full blown rambo and managed to fend off the shorters if you look at the volume friday in the last 5 minutes we went 2x in volume to 600k 3 retail is running low on funds most of us retards burned out our money pushing this shit up early in the week and have very few funds left making impossible to pull these sorts of transaction given the above i believe some hedge funds have entered the game to try to fk with their competitors make money and frame retail as the guilty party of this potentially taking down rh in the process if this is true and i dont know if it is next week we need to be extra careful to see what happens after the gamma squeeze finishes for me that will mean to keep track of volume because as soon as these undercover big boys are out i believe that it is the right time for me to get out either way what people think do we have some mms helping pour gasoline in the fire
167,68,2021-01-30 12:16:30,is it possible that setting very price high limit on your sells make it more likely that your shares are loaned out by your brokerage so i was just doing some random googling on loaning out of shares by brokers and i came across this quora thread granted its not the most reliable source but i thought it was interesting enough to mention this part specifically got me curious because i know a lot of people on here have crazy limits set on their gme positions and i am wondering if that is a good idea setting a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to continually sell and buy back some times hundreds of times in a matter of minutes your position with high frequency trading this often happens from algorithms or a black box this is not financial advice i just like the stock 
673,133,2021-01-30 12:10:00,gme is far from over regulation will come soon disclaimer if i couldve made this a coloring book i wouldve congrats retards weve officially reached the government discussion floor just like the greats zuck gates and pharma bro and now market regulation will sure come from this investigation however we cant settle for just any regulation we will be given regulation that looks like it will help us but will actually restrict us or regulation that wont do anything at all i keep seeing articles such as the one below that officials want to raise taxes on the rich to make this right this is a bullshit solution that doesnt fix the root of the problem 1 why someone can short 140 of a stock 2 why a broker can delist a stock whenever they want clearly most of us are retarded but we need udeepfuckingvalue and others that can clearly explain to regulators how the hedges fucked up and how we can stop it from happening again we cant allow a tax increase to be the fucking regulation and dont let people that didnt experience the panic of gme delisting tell you its good regulation sincerely retard 1344176

122,88,2021-01-30 11:43:09,why you should rethink using fintech apps like robinhood to trade stocks hello there it was a crazy week for most of us due to gme and other volatile stocks companies standing behind trading apps like robinhood have imposed restrictions on trading gme stocks where to trade if not on robinhood look for trading accounts via banks like brokerage checking accounts banks charge fees but you are going to be sure you wont get fucked by them just like by robinhood or trading 212 fintechs if youre using trading apps to invest in stocks at least read terms of services so you would know what to expect if shit hits the fan some brokers have their headquarters in financial havens like cayman islands did you know that that is why i chose banks there is a lot of pros for using banks to invest when you make an order through bank you have certainity that your order will be executed instantly on the market banks dont sell data about your trades to hedge funds there is no conflict of interest beetwen you as an investor and your bank becouse it charges fee so the more you make the more bank makes win win situation they have no interest to fuck you they want you to make more and more money banks can provide a lot of analytic tools and real fast support in case of some issues i hope you are going to rethink using frauded brokers like robinhood or trading 212 they dont play fair they fuck us so why shouldnt we fuck them by denying to use them and destroying their reputation i wish yall calm weekend and huge profits next week 
144,198,2021-01-30 11:40:07,psa robinhood insolvency dangers robinhood appears to be on the verge of insolvency based on a few data points 1 to continue operating it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between $500 million and $600 million 2 they had to raise an emergency $1 billion from investors today 3 they stopped allowing users to buy gme and other meme stonks for a full day yesterday 4 they have severely limited or blocked 50 stocks including lots of non meme stonks more are likely 5 they are not allowing people to exercise their options instead they are automatically selling them at a price of their choosing 6 there appears to be a bank run on robinhood as people are fed up with the restrictions this is a negative feedback loop if robinhood goes under the sec will freeze all the accounts the sipc protects up to $500k in accounts it takes months to unwind and get your money back you might want to move any free floating money now or get out of any positions that arent but most importantly if you have digital currencies at robinhood it appears you will lose everything i am not bullshitting look at their how youre protected support page for yourself x200b edit because no one reads anything i am not saying sell gme or any other meme stonk hold them what i am saying is get out of your digital currency positions
509,149,2021-01-30 11:35:48,if gme squeezes tsla will dip hard dont forget to buy the dip gme squeezing will cause a 2030 market correction as the liquidity necessary to cover all the short positions is obtained by selling off other positions in the market the only day this week that the indexes closed higher than they opened was the day where robinhoes restricted trading because on the other days short sellers had to meet their growing margin requirements by selling other stocks this coming just after teslas earnings miss and the fact that its a major component of the sp 500 and is considered to be a huge bubble by institutions will literally drive tesla stock into the dirt unfairly mind you because my price target for them is still $1600 frankly that target is conservative youre going to have the opportunity to get relatively cheap leaps on something that will triple in the next four years so buy the fucking dip roll over all your gme gains and own a piece of the best evrenewablestech company of this century elon will take us all to tendie town again squeeze gme and use the hedge funds own money to monopolize the future of our economy and country positions cash for buying that dip baby
588,238,2021-01-30 11:31:23,earlier today robinhood started rejecting limit prices on gme for over $8000 a dude i works with texted me today and said he couldnt put a limit on gme for $50000 then he tried $20000 then he tried $10000 nothing robinhood just kept saying we cant process your request because you will make us go fucking bankrupt if the sell order is that far out then he tried $8000 boom it worked so i told him to try putting a high limit on another stock he could put any limit he wanted on any other stock without issue what does this mean this means that $50000 is not a meme as long as you keep control of the shares you control the share price basic supplydemand there are literally not enough shares available for melvins side of the bet to work out the math just simply doesnt check out for him this whole situation wouldnt have happened if he didnt make a horrible bet if we all have $69420 sell orders imo this is a very conservative and fair entry point for gme investors then when melvin starts closing their massive positions the market will be absolutely flooded with buy orders eventually those buy orders will find our $69420 wall and eat it right up the supply of shares to fulfill his side of the bet literally doesnt exist there arent enough sharesso theoretically the price can go infinitely in two months you can invent a number and then request that number for your sharesmelvins gotta pay it all you gotta do is have those shares when hes looking for them weve got this everyone has our backs the only way for them to get out of this is if we sell or if they break the law with the whole world watching youve got this its over for them they know it robinhood knows it citadel knows it its over all you need to do it wait

1204,339,2021-01-30 10:29:57,what is to come is not our fault  free gme its becoming clearer and clearer what is coming in the future as robinhood restricts purchases on owning more than 1 share in multiple tickers we can extrapolate why they are pulling every illegal move in the book they are out of money youve heard liquidity crisis well it means they dont have enough money to pay for our fair legally made gains hence the $1 billion dollar infusion decimating the clearing house may restructure parts of the economy but it was never our fault melvin citadel all these short positions took on a stupid bet weve been taught to never go full retard but that exactly what theyve been doing shorting over 100 of the physical shares their bad investment cannot be blamed on us small investors just because we bought the stock we like now theyre taking proactive not reactive measures because they know what is to come forcing low prices to scoop up users whove invested on margin selling to each other to simulate a sell off that will never come literally saying you cant buy the most basic investment a single share for now we hold everyday we hold they lose billions every day they lose billions due to their own position we inch closer to the inevitable payout a payout they cant afford if they continue to hold their losing position what is to come is bankruptcy the upside is we can hold this stock longer than they can take on debt we can stay retarded longer than they can remain solvent is not a joke considering their retarded position heres some post i stole of some nerd on the internet in this case collateral requirements on gme went up because of its volatility so while before robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of gme for every hundred it traded it now had to at close of business pony up one hundred shares worth of collateral for every hundred it traded that creates a cash crunch one that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security if robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls they go out of business overnight so when citadel and robinhood cant pay out despite telling people to shut up and sell remember it was never our fault position 24 shares of gme not selling until i see billionaires go homeless for betting against americans enjoy your weekend fucking idiots go spend some time with your family ps and to the sec you have a choice either restrict americans from buying a single share on the free market setting a precedent of market manipulation or force shorts to close out some of their mindnumbingly stupid positions just like they did to us edit i see your concerns about what happens if they bankrupt or the stock plummets your cash is insured up to a certain amount $250000 if a bankruptcy occurs the stock will only plummet if people mass sell but its not happening the news the movement all fuel imo dont sell we are stronger together my investment advice has always been dont put in anything you cant afford to lose that way you are always protected thank you for the awards buy gme

1183,141,2021-01-30 09:56:21,inside the mind of a hedge fund executive imagine youre a hedge fund ceo or senior executive youve always had an inflated ego and going to wharton for an mba definitely didnt help in that regard you interned at gs for the summer of 2003 and told all your friends about it probably even brought it up oh so casually on dates when you were hired as a trader by a moderately good to great fund you probably lost a good deal of friends from your previous life because they just dont get you now youre in a different league than them even your classmates that now work at lesser funds you act friendly liking facebook posts returning their calls but theres a nagging feeling that theyre holding you back that youve made it and you dont need some loser that doesnt even work on the east coast jump ahead a few years its september 20th 2008 bear stearns closed months earlier lehman went bankrupt a few days ago buddies of yours from both funds have been texting you some you know from college maybe youll take pity on them and put in a good word maybe youll tell them nothings available right now and that youre sorry you dont tell them you were part of your funds effort to short sell theirs into oblivion maybe you really are sorry though what youre more sorry about however is that your bonuses are probably going to be shit for a few years they could even dip into five figures god forbid your thoughts are of course directed to the millions of people losing their jobs across the country by the news but inevitably your bonus reduction resurfaces as your biggest concern its not like i can do anything you say after downing some wine you go to sleep fairly easily while across the country innumerable people are forced to contemplate moving lets jump ahead a few more years its midmarch 2020 at this point its become evident that covid19 is going to ravage the world in some capacity not gonna put politics into this because thats not the point as either a ceo or senior executive at a midrange hedge fund your thoughts gravitate towards your craft its clear the market is going to tank so you do what you do best you short the shit out of several clearly sinking industries but you dont stop there you go on cnbc fox business maybe even the bbc and announce doom and gloom doing this will get people to dump their stocks meaning your shorts print even more money oh well if theres a positive to be gained from this whole thing its your fund making good money right by late march or early april your wife convinces you that going with the kids to the hamptons would be the best choice since the upper east side is getting a little claustrophobic youll need to cancel your two week st barts vacation what a bummer you rent out a nice beach house in sag harbor for 125k a month managing to beat out the other bidder by upping them by 10k once again millions of people are losing their jobs and youre shorting the companies they work for what else should you do only a few months forward this time its october weeks turned into months and while youve started getting back to the city more and more youre still staying in sag sometimes you have family friends over for an ostensibly socially distanced wine cigar you dont think much of the events of the summer aside from that one tweet you had pr send out in july your kids might have thoughts you havent asked just a few more months i promise its january for really no other reason than the prospect of making more money you along with a few other funds have decided to open naked shorts on gamestop while technically not allowed there are loopholes why would the loopholes be there if not to be exploited right not like you dont do the same thing with your taxes then the unthinkable happens a bunch of retail investors led by a specific part of reddit decide to fuck your position by dramatically raising the share price since you firmly believe these people incapable of sticking to such an audacious play you do nothing before long though you start to become slightly unnerved by how steady the growth of the stock is its approaching $100 and youre losing hundreds of thousands to millions every day on short interest so you decide to take action you get on cnbc and cry about fundamentals about volatility crushing these people they dont listen and keep buying a week passes with you and your rich friends trying various strategies none of it working youre aware of another fund leaning on a popular trading app to force them into not accepting buy orders for gme amongst others youre not above sacrificing pride for money so you announce your fund has closed its shorts youre lying of course what kind of looks what you get at future parties if you cowed to these people no fuck that youve read all the right books been to the right schools made the right friends networked at the right parties and functions you will not close everything in your life has conditioned you not to in fact youll double down you go on cnbc some more artificially lower the stock price by trading between a few other funds none of its working and youre intensely aware of another potential gamma squeeze on friday restrictions on buying help during the day but after hours the stock jumps that momentum carries it into a solid friday you wont budge but at this point youre losing millions of dollars a day so here we are these people do not care about you youre the least of their concerns actually they care about money and fund image in that order we have a real chance to make guys exactly like this hurt where it counts for them and i want people to understand that im not saying throw your rent into gme im saying you have the chance to really be a part of something to screw the people that have been doing the screwing for your whole life the house has been running a fixed casino and you have the chance to hit back do not close we have them and they know it were winning and if we keep winning they will give in
212,89,2021-01-30 09:44:28,gen x is here with stock and buying power this is from my post a few days ago listens you young retards and from udeepfuckingvalue original thesis $gme is a good growth stock with a potential for a squeeze i finally believed in december when i bought 2000 shares i will do anything possible to buy something i want now without going to a big box store mainly because i hate everything about thempeople infant and toddler kids walking a mile through the store waiting 20 minutes to checkout the shakedown at the door and the fucking disaster of the giant parking lots when my kids want a game or for me we go on web find where the game is available and go get it there arent any in the dead boomer malls close by game stops are all in anchor strip malls they are where your local grocery store is in and out of the store in a few minutes unless we browse there are no hard pressure sales but you guys know that we also now own the game and they can take it to their moms grandparents where ever without moving the console i easily spend $600 a year there point is ill be utilizing this business model as long as its available and im sure there are many other genx parents that will do as well gme edit gme 2000 shares bought in mid december game stop will be the central place for gaming in a year buy and hold downloading games is a cool idea but my isp starts charging more after around 10gb why id still rather own a game that i can buy at $gme instead of paying more to download a game i never really own
172,99,2021-01-30 09:37:28,today wealth simple limited their limit sell feature to 30 above their delayed quote price 15 minutes i am in canada this is a canadian brokerage uk can weigh in i was to be driving through the mountains with no cell service today during market hours for this reason i had preemptively placed some limit sell orders i placed these at levels of someone who likes this stock would make these were made in canada on wealth simple these were approved and moved to my pending orders these remained all day when the market closed and i arrived home i cancelled to re asses my plan of attack for monday to my dismay i was given an error wealth simple would not let me place new limit sell orders in the similar ranges i immediately reached out to their customer service via email a pop up alerted me it would be 24 hours to hear back i heard back within an hour here is a clip of what a polite customer service rep gave responded with there is a maximum on how far you can set your limit price as the us executing brokerages will reject any orders too far away from the real price of the us stock or etf limit orders will be required to have a limit price within 30 of the delayed quoted price to reduce the risk of the orders being rejected by executing brokers so wealth simple in this time of massive swings wants us to set limit orders at 30 on their 15 minute lagged price pretty much ensuring i do not get what i aim to not only that but they currently have a warning about using the market sell feature for this specific ticker however when a stock is moving up so quick how can you set a limit price of 30 terrible time to do this not only that when i reached out further they gave me a due to covid we may not respond for up to 3 days i bet they are being inundated with frustrated traders good luck trading with a 15 minute lag this makes things more difficult delayed quote price needed to expose this hoping they will revert or improve the percentage or the limit sell feature is useless in the play i had anticipated if mods need to see screenshots or emails i have everything also please weigh in if this is happening to you brokerages playing dirty should be exposed in this time x200b edit this is gme obviously to the fucking moon x200b edit again if you value your users do not pull this shit in times like these i will be transferring out of wealth simple and will express my feelings on a review i would encourage anyone who has been similarly effected to do the same after you sell gme as it may make the difference its not too late change back this weekend and i will forgive you x200b edit holy crap faith restored they have seen the error of their ways this has been changed back to original settings x200b i will keep my wealth simple
50,50,2021-01-30 09:22:05,the short swing profit rule how gme can cashin via rc ventures i see a lot of chatter right now about how gmes current stock price doesnt actually help the company which is for the most part true in order for gamestop to actually benefit from this price movement they would need to tap the capital markets most likely by doing a stock offering near current prices to do so you need to have enough deeppocketed investors who are willing to purchase at that price not to mention increasing the float could significantly hurt the ongoing short squeeze psychology yes there are other ways to take advantage of the share price allstock acquisitions etc but none of them are as straightforward as getting cash in hand however there is one way for gamestop to use todays prices to benefit the company financially the short swing profit rule the shortswing profit rule also known as the section 16b rule is an sec regulation that prevents insiders in a publicly traded company from reaping shortterm profits the shortswing profit rule requires company insiders to return to the company any profits made from the purchase and sale of company stock if both transactions occur within a sixmonth period this rule applies to any shareholder officer or director who owns more than 10 of a class of the companys equity securities registered under the securities exchange act obviously insider sales are tightly regulated but if ryan cohen aka rc ventures were to sell a portion of his 9001000 shares currently worth $28b roughly 13 of the company he would then be required to return those profits directly to the company this would arguably be the best possible way to capitalize on the situation providing positive news that in some ways might help substantiate the current valuation i wont offer my own opinion here tldr ryan cohen rc ventures can raise money for gme by selling and sacrificing his profits this cash would help gme on the path to turning around the business so this may be a winwin situation the other take away from this is that rc ventures cannot sell without passing along those profits so effectively 13 of shares outstanding is completely tied up disclaimer this is not financial advice i am not a financial advisor and everything i am telling you comes from the internet so please do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions
188,197,2021-01-30 09:17:11,possible theory on how gme could crash the whole market please correct any mistakes in my thinking i watched the interview with that old guy he stated they stopped trading because of the possibility a broker wouldnt be able to cover transactions if the loser failed to pay now we all make the assumption that he was talking about retail investors because the media has been blaming us for the last week but what if he meant they couldnt cover the bets made by hedge funds what if the hedge funds sold a shit fuck ton of call options way out of the money to cover their original shorts on gme at the start of trading that day gme was just under $500 per share and gaining if momentum continued and all options ended in the money another gamma squeeze would occur and hedge funds would have to cover all the options plus pay the interest on their short positions at $1000 per share in order to come up with that amount of cash i would imagine the hedge funds would have to liquidate other stocks this would create a massive sell off of stocks which could potentially crash the market i was reading that the total capital of the market is in the $10s of trillions but there are $6070 trillion betting on which way the market moves if a massive sell off happens those betting that stonks only go up will lose and have to pay the winners but with all the stocks crashing they cant cover the losses the whole house of cards comes crashing downagain is this possible i am not in finance nor do i have any idea how all this works
161,31,2021-01-30 08:36:43,never selling thesis from new to stocks king autist tltr ive made a life changing amount of money but im not a fucking bitch and selling i personally hold 37 gme with believe it or not a $6969 average i like you all am an autist im very rookie and have just finished my first year trading ive benefited massively from the spac boom in early 2020 and have been making good progress growing my small pile of tendies to a much larger one i basically couldnt help my autism and went in with about 80 of my portfolio in gme with the other 20 in my favourite spac the money i have made is truly life changing for me and like many of you i refuse to sell family and friends are encouraging me to sell but i refuse and it keeps paying off im a firm believer that the squeeze has yet to begin and can see us hitting $5000 next week we will win and beat wallstreet at their own game i do think tho that those fuckers will be sore loseres and take people like me and you down with them somehow but all im saying is yolo im not fucking selling
211,141,2021-01-30 08:26:45,if gme gets squeezed on monday or tuesday and causes their $500 calls to go itm wont that force another compounding stream this is for entertainment purposes only and is not financial advice crazy question so if people who have held long positions in gme hold the past a gamma squeeze on monday or tuesday and it somehow pushed past the $500580 calls wont that force another squeeze and if people with enough shares and money to buy covering puts buy puts to coverbecause if you had a huge run up why wouldnt you want to protect against volatility wouldnt that force hedge funds to short sell to cover their put positions or sell empty puts meaning there is only one direction for everything to go ie if someone has 200 gme stock they bought at $17 and they have the $1200 to buy the $580p assuming it goes otm with an expiration around june wouldnt that force people to cover their short position and increase short interest this is for entertainment purposes only and is not financial advice
353,142,2021-01-30 08:23:02,whenever this epic saga comes to an end there are still 2 things we must band together to do 1 there needs to be a movie made about this story it needs to be done the right way i know nothing about to go about doing it but we should crowdfund some gains together to hire a writer and producers to get shopped around to major production companies and most importantly 2 we need to spend some money at gamestop all we have heard for the past few weeksmonths is how gme is trading above its value this is said by the same people that repeat ad nauseam that a stock price is not a reflection of whats in done in the past but what it will do in the future we are in control of what it does in the future its been at least 10 years since ive even owned a video game console but thats going to change im going to buy a ps5 and a new tv from them we owe it to gamestop to kick some of these gains back into their revenues x200b until then we like the stock
45,38,2021-01-30 08:18:30,can someone please advise on the below case has anybody been in similar situation i was trying to get in gme spreads on jan 28th but my order was not getting picked however they filled in my 570strike price spread which expires next week i was okay holding it as there will be squeeze till i learnt they placed restrictions which caused it now the problem is because of their actions the parameters have changed and we might not see squeeze over the next week and if that happens my options will expire worthless and ill lose 25k 1 i need legal advise is there a lawsuit here due to their actions parameters have changed and my holdings are screwed 2 can i rollover or any other better strategy i should consider

314,238,2021-01-31 03:33:41,gme expected range next week listen up retards here are the market makers levels that are currently being priced in for the following week for volatility on gme x200b for the prices they are selling puts and calls at the 325 strike price expiring 5th feb upper bound is roughly $575 and the lower $75 purple line this is the full straddle price the mm is getting for the options they are selling once price goes over this level they start to lose money they are not expecting price to go above or below these levels otherwise they would have made the options more expensive usually the mms try not to hedge as its expensive and is cheaper for them to defend those levels and or will rely on the gamma scalpers to start shorting the stock at the call line or the top boundary purple line traders who have bought the 325 calls will have a lot of value in those options and can short the stock risk free if they still have time value left on the option however if the mms think that the levels wont be shorted and there is too much long value in the stock they will buy to hedge themselves this however is not a normal market at the moment anyway some levels to watch next week to see if they try defend gme to the moon etc etc

204,233,2021-01-31 02:34:50,what can hedge funds do at this point legal or not before i even start ive been holding a few hundred shares of gme since 20 and been buying since cost basis around 60 im in this for the long haul havent considered selling fuck and wall st but now that weve seen exactly what lengths illegal ones hedge funds are willing to go through to ensure their profit and our loss what are some other possibilities of things both legal and not that they could do over the weekendearly next week to drive gme further down dont worry not selling until $10k a share 
190,128,2021-01-31 02:31:35,maybe im wrong here but a sharp increase in price from now forward could trigger the short squeeze if it holds im not 100 sure on this one but ive been thinking about it for a while short interest in gme has barely changed since this price increase began that means either people are holding for their dear lives or people thinking that gme will go back down as quick as it came up im beginning to think the latter people see this as an opportunity to earn what they think is free money if we rise to 400500 and hold it there not only will we fuck over a lot of the new shorters we may end up triggering a short squeeze as these idiots dont have the same capital or backing that melvin have and thus will be forced to buy back the shares in order to avoid going into negative balance this is just a theory but its enough of one for me to hold no matter what the price

7435,1030,2021-01-31 01:24:28,gme short squeeze act ii good day fellow retards we are entering a new stage of the short squeeze its apparent by now that its not playing out like the vw short squeeze because the setup was so long and out in the open hedge funds had time to collude and plan how theyre going to deal with the fallout as we saw last week they came up with some clever fuckery x200b for a recap here are some tactics we saw from them short attacks driving the price down triggering stop loss sells and trading halts spreading the word through the media that they had already closed their short positions putting pressure on brokers to limit buying of gme and killing the buy side of the trade making it easier to drive the price down low volume ladder attacks to drive the price down and forcing out paper hands x200b we held strong guys and gals we closed friday just a few dollars shy of the highest closing price on wednesday but now the real trench warfare begins melvin told cnbc that they closed out their short positions i have a theory that this may not be technically false with a caveat i think its very possible that hedgies have closed out their original short positions but theyve been replaced with new short positions these guys are not going to lose billions of dollars lying down so they must have their own end game for how to get out of the trade alive and perhaps even make a profit if gme was a tasty short target at $15 imagine how irresistible it is at $320 these fuckers lost their shirts on the original trade but they see an opportunity to make it back on this new trade by repositioning their old shorts from the $15 to new shorts in the $200300s x200b how can we know this is likely true the short interest has fluctuated so we know there has been some covering the short interest has remained high somewhere around 100 or above there have been short attacks in $100s $200s and $300s so we know there are new short positions at those levels hedge funds are cocky assholes and theyll do anything to turn a losing trade into a winning one and if it fucks over the little guy to scare them back to submission all the better x200b so basically nothing has changed this is still a short squeeze play just with much higher stakes we have the advantage however because it doesnt cost us anything to hold onto our shares whereas its costing hedgies billions of dollars to hold out we will know we are winning next week if we continue to see more degrossing in the broader market if we can hold out we can take this to the next leg up act iii and eventually the end game tldr x200b edit positions i own shares disclaimer i am not a professional this is not a recommendation
349,123,2021-01-31 01:09:31,word to the wise on talking about your positions people that have been around here for years will be able to corroborate an important point for newcomers there is a lot of frenzy and hype about gme and if youre along for the ride congrats its easy for it to be all consuming and youll want to talk about it with everyone just be restrained in your discussions when a lot of $ is involved it can affect relationships permanently or the way people look at you youll feel like youre in some secret club coming to wsb read some posts and feel like an expert trader word from the wise just keep it to yourself or talk about it in very restrained manner depending on the audience youve seen the hedgies will do anything to stop us so there is a good chance this wont work out the way you expect it too either and when that happens people will think back and say wow he was just a shill after all be careful and good luck

127,142,2021-01-30 22:04:00,effect of calls expiring itm on friday with gme closing above 320 that allowed people to exercise their options to buy shares on any itm contract the calls with the highest open interest were 320 and almost everything between 100 and 200 so what i am confused about is how does this benefit retail gme shareholders i understand it decreases the amount of available shares which only helps load up the rocket to alpha centauri however what is stopping hedge funds from buying the contracts before close themselves and exercising allowing them to start getting an advantage in owning more shares once they own the shares cant they just sell covered calls on them into next week and start making enough to make back a portion of losses is there even enough shares available to allow everyone to exercise edit thank you for the replies i understand better now one last question of course shorts will not willingly be covering at 500 losses and will try to drag this out as long as possible in hopes that us retards cave in ultimately is the thing that will set this off the brokers who will start closing the shorts for the hedge funds at any price because hedge funds are unable to meet margin requirements and pay off their interests im assuming this is represented by the days to cover number

220,107,2021-02-01 00:05:08,what this sub was about this is probably going to be downvoted to hell but i think it needs to be said and hopefully some of yall read it it seems the prevailing sentiment right now is all about sticking it to wall st even if it means losing money while i can empathize with that that is not what this sub was all about this sub was mostly about making money through risky bets everything else be damned in early 2020 the majority on this sub bet the pandemic would ruin the economy thereby costing people jobs a lot of us made money around late spring the sentiment changed the majority on this sub went bullish and again made a lot of money sentiment changed daily during the trade war with china while there mightve been some animus against wall st that was not the motivation it was money and unbridled greed but it feels like some are now embarrassed to admit this this sub has grown massively in the last week and if the majority now wants it to be about taking a stand and sticking it to wall st so be it but know that the gme situation is very likely a once in a decade or even lifetime occurrence for a lot of us this is the only opportunity to make a lot of money quickly and while it would be great if a short squeeze happens no one knows for certain what will happen a lot of posts are just regurgitating weeks to months old data and dd so if you are just getting in now bet only what you can afford to lose one last thing whatever happens for the love of god please switch from robinhood after the dust settles our nemesis has a good thread on this since some of yall will ask i scrub my post comment history regularly no that does not mean im a short seller trying to get yall to sell i was in and out of gme from last fall until last week will be buying back in should there be another drop like on thursday

10548,2060,2021-02-01 00:09:10,for everyone that just joined because of $gme and dont know wtf is going on  firstly now down to business you have just been thrusted into a once in a lifetime phenomenon its public knowledge now that the covid pandemic has increased the wealth of the worlds top 10 billionaires by over 30 around $1 trillion and that the crisis has led to the largest transfer of wealth from poor to rich since 2008 where do these billionaires keep their billions you might ask no not their jp morgan savings account their money is managed by investment banks and hedgefunds these same firms citadel melvin viking etc are now losing billions around $70 billion as of last week trying to short companies profit from their failure they have not yet been successful where do we come into all of this the reason gamestop hasnt dropped in price despite the hedgefunds best efforts is because the majority of the shares have been bought by retail investors the little guy you and me and the hedgefunds need us to sell them in order to buy and manage their short positions the longer we hold out selling and buy more the more these hedgefunds will demand shares pushing the price up squeezing their short position are you too late to the party the stock is at around $300 right now the short squeeze hasnt even happened yet its realistic that the stock could go to $5000 per share if the gme short squeeze in proportion reached the same comparable levels as the vw porsche squeeze gme stock could reach $30k per share this is our chance to reverse the wealth transfer thats taken place due to the pandemic and even 2008 and also make a statement that times have changed and we wont stand for billionaires profiting off the downfall of businesses and destroying the little guy 15000 people are out of a job if the hedgefunds win and gamestop goes under thats 15000 people who are potentially the only source of income for an entire family when all is said and done ask yourself what side of history do you want to have been on what to do buy every share not owned by the hedges loses them more money and drives the price up hold they cant cover if we dont sell this will also drive the price up buy the dip the stock will dip this is natural and can be used to get in at a discount dont sell when we get to $1k it will be tempting but youll kick yourself when its at $10k $20k $k do your own research this is not financial advice i am not an expert i just like the stock edit the short squeeze hasnt happened yet
103,125,2021-01-31 13:58:11,long term gme question feels like there used to be a lot more discussion about gme long term when was the last time you heard the word omnichannel lol its probably only been like a week but damn the last week has felt like it has taken years off of my life my question is this should gme capitalize on the moment and issue shares to be able to truly set themselves up for the long term imagine if they issued enough shares to make a sizable acquisition like steam that would truly give them a serious foothold in the pc gaming industry thoughts anyways gme to the moon baby hold hold hold this is not financial advice im a lucky retard that got in back in december edit 1 been told i dont have enough emojis forever together strong rip harambe dicks out forever 
233,215,2021-01-31 12:56:19,im all for this sub been here for a year but shits going to get bad they big investors are trying to act like victims cohen quit twitter because of threats people will see as wsb sec is lurking and trying to find anything possible to screw wsb over best believe that once they find something as much as a threat to the hedgefund guys that relates to us theyre going to put out the news and gme is gonna shoot down keep that in mind everyone play clean here fuck them of course but no threats fuck those scumbags lets get these fatbags baby edit i like this stock im not against you guys im just looking at what is possible theyre going to try and fuck us and shut us down or something they dont want brokes to win this we just like the stock the im retarded as well wait whats a threat im retarded
78,43,2021-01-31 12:43:00,transfer of wealth from top to bottom obviously this whole thing has become bigger than itself and only making the wealth gap issue more apparent anyway heres my indica induced theory on how a huge transfer of wealth might happen theres other posts about how the short is gonna gamma and infiniti money glitch firm will have to sell off assets to buy gme everything will tank for a week and at that time all of the retail investors especially new ones should buy fucking dip literally take the hedge funds wealth straight from them hold it and wait for it to become your wealth or something like that idk im a dummy obviously not financial advise or any different from what millionaires and billionaires do on cnbc every day and boomer investors salivate over their gospel 
140,85,2021-01-31 12:41:57,are hedge funds in trouble they might get out of gme with minimal loses without triggering the squeeze but with halting the trading going on a tv and spewing out lies about wallstreetbets like saying its an organization or all the pundits saying how short positions were closedwhile the math didnt add up and im not even talking about how all the powerful people got away with coronavirus insider trading without repercussions but as soon as a regular joe started to make a dime suddenly everyones talking about regulations i feel like theyve just poked a beehive i feel like gme is just a battle and not a war the real war will begin once people open vanguardfidelity accounts and all the money deposits get processed then the internet will be unstoppable i feel like gme is just the tip of an iceberg and the real storm is coming
330,191,2021-01-31 12:39:13,leave rh i wasnt going to play this time around played all summer rode some shit up rode some shit down was gonna sit gme out thursday changed my mind i liquidated 15k to come in at open and on dips through friday rh said nope and then nope again and nope again as soon as this is over im moving every fucking penny out im not upvoting any more posts that screenshot rh and i think there should be brokerage flair for users on the sub fuck these guys
1875,687,2021-01-31 12:12:59,can we all just admit we are nervous and have no fucking clue whats about to happen im 100 confident that had it not been for the buy limits placed last week a short squeeze or at least a gamma squeeze wouldve occurred however this blatant market manipulation might keep happening on monday and we dont know what effect it will have what we do know is that tons of new people have signed up for trading apps and a portion of them will buy gme this means less available shares for the shorters which helps our cause i am pretty nervous about how in the dark we are about what the hedge funds have planned this coming week could either be a huge win a stalemate or a letdown regardless though whats important is that we are standing up for what we believe in keep holding my fellow warriors no matter what happens next week 
162,117,2021-01-31 12:07:01,robinhood is the clearing house havent seen anything on this yet robinhood is trying to shift the blame away to the clearing houses and not themselves they literally have no money to settle gme shares or anything else lmao thats why they are restricting all those stocks they are the clearing house oh yea anyone like 5 spreads on their market order tldr rh doesnt have enough cash to cover the margin and stock settlement they literally are drawing on a billion dollars so they dont go insolvent 
120,192,2021-01-31 12:02:13,my wild ass guess at how gme plays out this isnt financial advise as i am not a financial advisor im concerned that the strong will that exists may be less strong if there is not immediate gratification for retail shareholders particularly those who bought in over 90 and who could see big swings before the trip to valhalla just putting a few things out there so all us smooth brains have time to digest the possibilities edit to be clear dont spend what you cant afford to lose i am not saying to to buy options im saying that the lack of this happening this week may cause the price to drop so your smooth brain better be ready for the ride tldr best case scenario is retail investors buying far otm options and letting large whales support the price on the way up this is unlikely because premiums are jacked to the tits making them too expensive for retail itm options that are not exercises dont help the cause but new itm options are too expensive to exercise for you and your wifes boyfriend early diamond hands win long term but not before most of your friends turn into paper handed pussi bois a trip to valhalla could actually crash the market to make sure you dont lose your gme tendies on other plays i have read a lot of mixed guesses at how this plays out and i want to get a read on what the hive mind thinks infinite squeeze three concurrent squeezes there are three squeezes going on 1 the squeeze from retailer buyers piling into a stock thinking it is a ticket to valhalla 2 the gamma squeeze from far otm options contracts going itm 3 the actual short squeeze 1 2 are happening 3 is not happening as new shorts have replaced old shorts so a thesis need to be made on each individual squeeze and on the macro scenario immediate term retail squeeze 1 immediate term i dont see retail stopping people will inevitably make bad decisions and continue to pile into the stock at almost any price this has turned into a worldwide phenom so its not just us investors the entire world is getting in on the action gamma squeeze 2 the most complicated of the bunch imo the price rise we have seen is only from 1 2 so far and mostly from 2 the question here is will it continue im not sure this is the area where the hedge funds have the most knowledge and the most control over pricing that said its not just the shorts at this point multiple hedge funds have jumped in on both sides of the trade this means its billionaire vs billionaire imo retail will have no impact in this area because this is totally dependent on buying otm options contracts en masse that go itm causing mm to buy shares to cover this almost caused the real squeeze on thursday before retail buying was cut off the reason it could have happened last week but not in the future is because the high from the option chain a week ago was 60 the high from the option chain yesterday was averaging out 320 they added new highs everyday last week which is why we saw such a battle at the 320 price on friday close for the gamma squeeze to continue the price must go up bigly as far into the extreme otm options too highly priced for retail as possible if it happens it could trigger the real squeeze i think this is the angle long hedge positions are attempting buy otm calls drive price up on low volume exercise shares again retail cant do this because 320 100 32k and then hold shares for squeeze 3 the trip to valhalla 3 it will happen at some point but no one knows when that point will be it very well could be a year from now or it could be monday the longer it goes on the more chance there is for something to happen that would eliminate it from happening x200b how much is actually short the common knowledge says gme is 130 short sold but im going to consider the hedge funds more sophisticated than that and assume that positions like synthetic longs and other hedges we are not aware of are in play driving down real short to something extreme but not totally unwindable for the shorts if they get lucky so something like this could happen assume a squeeze could be prevented at 20 less short than wherever we are currently what if gme issues that much in new shares the get gobbled up by shorts not eliminating their upcoming ass fucking by delaying it long enough that retail interest fades or the sec steps in the nyse delists gme for fraud or some other existential threat comes into play so the question is will these squeezes happen best case scenario is that 1 or 2 work and 3 is triggered this is the infinite squeeze if that happens many millionaires are minted but that seems unlikely meaning what else could happen what is likely here a take hedge funds attempt 2 it doesnt work because long options are so expensive high volatility etc gme shorts have enough capital to keep fucking with price action easier to do with low volume and retail taps out on buying options because they are expensive at the same time retail continues to pile into shares options are too expensive when hedge longs fail the price drops as mm can unwind their extreme positions retail shits their pants sells this isnt out of the question as retail was already a net seller last week thats right there are paper hands among us the price goes right back down to 40 anyone who wasnt in at a low cost basis ie most people sell shares gme shorts profit off hedge positions on the way up down giving them enough capital to fight another day gme does a stock issuance putting more shares into the market 3 is still on the table but the timeline moves from days to months giving shorts a long runway to unwind and a perfect highly volatile environment to play both sides against the middle to be net neutral or within a tolerable margin of loss on their original position so we are left with short term 1 pushes 2 into happening with assistance of long hedge help which pushes 3 into happening or paper hands shake out everyone but the earliest entrants what would help retail buying otm options helps but it really helps if they can exercise the option this takes a lot of cash most wont be able to good options moving itm price moving higher bad highest concentration of options expiring next friday doesnt happen retail thinks things are moving too slow paper hands best thing that could happen is retail continues to buy far otm options along with long hedge support of price which spikes price soon what might hurt if the trip to valhalla actually takes off we may get rich but the big boys are going to be selling off other stocks like crazy there is a real liquidity issue in the market right now you saw it this week with the brokerageclearinghouse fuckups and historically systemic liquidity issues lock up the market and real crashes happen so if 3 happens pay attention to your other positions and consider hedging your wins again not financial advice thoughts lets discuss positions gme shares uvxy 125c 25 spy 370p 219

94,98,2021-01-31 11:25:50,how much you want to bet melvin took long positions on gme to cover their shorts am i the only one that thinks the melvin gme takedown conference announcement and cancellation is market manipulation because i was seeing that thinking that there was no way you could make your position look more weak than that unless thats not your actual position anymore stock shorted all to hell a public whos out to get you and teach you a lesson looks like easy money if you just happened to have slowly and quietly loaded up on shares ahead of time idk maybe im just cynical congratulations on the squeeze guys i was honestly doubting the shit out of it x200b edit shouldnt have used the word cover because now people think im talking about hedging i meant that i think they may have taken such a large long position that its their dominant position on the stock they seemed almost eager for a squeeze imo
24,21,2021-01-31 11:21:31,a question about reinvesting into $gme my earlier post was deleted i dont know why mods plz dm me to explain why if i did something wrong first off i have absolutley have no financial experience what so ever hell i only joined wsb this week and i have already have fallen in love with this community so we all know what might happen if the true squeeze occurs and what will happen after it my question would be wouldnt it be a smart idea to reinvest some if the gains into gme in the post squeeze super dip that i would imagine is coming from what i have learned doing some dd on this subreddit and its this gamestop was doing ok not great before covid the company got some investment from ryan cohen who even was given a board seat as well as 2 friends from chewy they plan to move the company away from brick and mortar stores and turn gamestop into an online store like steam i guess there is a new console generation where the supply is so low that people are fighting over ps5s at stores all the media attention has brought gamestop to the forefront of almost everyones mind even those who dont play video games in the us and has for most part for most people put the company in an extremely positive light as the underdog as far as ive heard the rumor is gamestop had serious issues raising captial due to number of reasons mostly being over shorted and covid hiting a bm store i bet but now due to the short squeeze and it taking over every tv in the world i wouldnt be surprised if more investors came in to help gamestop after the dust settles my thoughts would be after short squeeze happened those of us who sell $gme it would be a smart move to rebuy $gme and once again ill say it again i have no financial experience and this is nothing more than an educated guess love to hear the opinions of it who at least have some wrinkles in their smooth brains tldr reinvesting into gme after short squeeze maybe a good idea

0,147,2021-01-31 11:13:58,gme devils advocate alright this is going to be brutal on karma im confident this will get downvoted to hell but fuck it early gme holders people who bought $50 or so you can keep walking youre all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades people whore buying gme at current levels maybe ill be completely wrong and youll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing or maybe ill be right and it will be loss porn galore for days im leaning towards the second heres why gme is trading at a ridiculous premium short squeeze or not gamma squeeze or not if youre buying in now you might see a few days or even a few weeks worth of green that will be lifechanging but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you dont even think youre playing against ill explain this in a bit right now the general public and especially wsb consensus is that gme is going to keep squeezing because of 100 short interest and thats a fundamentally valid reason but those who are buying these gme shares where do you think theyre coming from heres a hint initially melvin and shitron were the primary shorters they shorted the stock around $10 or so thus making their max profit $10share if gme had gone bankrupt but as you keep squeezing higher and even worse as you keep buying at higher prices though melvin and shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses i say would because i dont know for a fact that they already have despite what cnbc says many other hedge funds wouldve opened new ones now why the fuck would they do that simple you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back and is now 30x that raising potential returns by at least 30x of course the stock doesnt even have to go back to $10 even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels think about it who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor new hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game or had a very small position at best you dont think youre playing against them but you are the energy and focus seem so concentrated on melvin and the gang that you dont even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath eventually time will come when profitseekers with long positions will begin entering the market or when retail investors wouldve exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky it will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days maybe even hours the fuck am i trying to say well im not advocating for a liquidation here and neither am i telling you to stop buying that decision is yours to make with the information you gather all im saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing you the retail investor are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay but just know there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ gme goes up and not a single one of them stands agnostic theyve all got a bet open and its most likely against you at these levels this is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits hope you all have a great weekend and do well in feb

0,62,2021-01-31 09:53:10,stop overlooking kodak listen up retards i know you have a short attention span so ill make this quick kodak originally skyrocketed when news of a government $765m loan was announced to kick start them into becoming a pharmaceutical company during the midst of the pandemic yes yes i know kodak seems like the company trying to jump on the bandwagon a cryptocurrency in 2017 and now pharma in 2020 anyway it retraced most of its gains when the sec opened up an investigation on wrongdoing related to expected insider trading about a month and a half ago the conclusion was made that there was no wrongdoing related to insider trading the loan etc now that doesnt mean it will still go through but it certainly doesnt mean it wont kodak has made several announcements they will be getting into pharma whether or not the loan goes through with covid still looming i dont see what would have changed regarding the loan and with the original announcement being mid last year an update must be coming regarding kodak pharma the market cap is only 700 million dollars micro cap this is minuscule its less than the amount of money the government was going to give them and is why kodak went up so much when it was announced its literally more than the company was even worth market cap is important because it means kodak has the potential to increase heavily over its current share price of $960 the higher the market cap the more money required for a stock price to increase for example people are buying nokia which already has a 30 billion market cap thats not going anywhere significant with nothing significant happening presently relatively high short interest of 255 as of last week this could spark a huge run if price gets out of control it would force shorts to cover its obviously not one of the very top shorted companies but its up there and with explosive price action kodak is known to have shorts seem to probably expect this by now once it breaks the current resistance it may fly catching the shorts off guard huge bullish flagpennant technical setup is primed to breakout check the longer term chart my positions not huge 500 shares 15 25 calls 15 219 calls buying more long dated calls monday x200b also buying more gme notice do not sell your gme for this

178,178,2021-01-31 08:59:58,do the greedy have a way out a gme share offering and sec rule 105 go to the bottom for a tldr and skip past all the thoughts of a crayon eater im an eternally optimistic smooth brain but countless and humbling failures from over confidence have taught me to be better at checking every blindspot ive made one post about ways we could be left holding bags of gme already but this scenario was overlooked that combined with adhdfueled deep diving led me to sec rule 105 what is rule 105 it says that greedy cant short in order to try and drive down the price and then buy from through a new offering to cover their short if greedy violate it they pretty much just pay a fine and there have been annual occurrences of violating rule 105 since 2013 bare with me im going to try and do math for example the hedge fund millennium paid $638709 for 4 violations where 10000 were shorted each using 40000 total that works out to a fine of $16 for each shorted although its very hard to speculate the size of a possible rule 105 fine for the gme shorts lets guess based on this one example for the sake of overly simplified argument because i dont think my brain or yours could possibly handle trying to make it more complicated this also assumes gme is going to do an offering soon will offer 58m to cover 100 of the shorts and sell them all to the shorts i very much doubt thats realistic and gme wouldnt sell them to the that tried to make them go bankrupt but what if it did happen greedy always pay less than the current price so lets say they pay $150 to gme to close the shorts entirely $150 x 58m $8700000000 $87b to gme now lets say they pay a fine of $16 to pay for their sins to the sec $16 x 58m $928000000 $928m to the sec $87b $928m $963b less than $10b to get out of the mess they put themselves in given that the current risk for the is theoretically unlimited why wouldnt they do it as i said im about as regarded as they come this scenario is probably unrealistic and definitely over simplified but is any of this an actual out for the that could result in all of us holding bags ive also yet to find a rule that says different that arent short cant buy newly offered from gme and then sell them to the that need to cover their shorts so maybe thats a possibility tldr given how unrealistic this seems and the fact there are also sec rules against doing it my final forecast for gme this week is bois and girls because we like the stock and ill see you in a galexy unknown lots of words explaining rule 105 gme 27 shares at $89 7 shares at $350
475,163,2021-01-31 08:42:03,should you buy gme repost because gay bots should you buy index funds and make a safe return no buy gme should i buy dividend stocks because were expecting a market crash no buy gme should you buy gold to hedge the market no buy gme wondering if you should buy that tesla no buy gme and youll get two teslas should i buy a house since low interest rates no buy gme well i think i would yield better returns investing with bernie madoff true but hes also buying gme im saving up for a wedding ring for udeepfuckingvalue should i buy gme yes thats what he would want you to do all of my liquidity is in lehman brothers do you think i would make a better return elsewhere yes gme im already in ornamental gourd futures and yielding a 69420 gain per day will i get more in gme no you wont stick with your play i already own gme good now hold i own a hedge fund and currently shorting gme but im down a couple thousand percent should i still buy gme fuck you buy prison calls not financial advice i just love the stock
349,117,2021-01-31 08:41:30,why what happened with gme is the beggining of the end of the hedge fund industry hedge funds fear wsb and for good reason guys it is the beggining of their end the implications of what is happening with gme go far beyond of what is happening with the stock price so i want to give my point of view of what is happening and why gme investors are doing a favour not only to themselves but to the whole world and i am not exagerating wealthy investors do not need hedge funds anymore the fact that hedge funds that waste expend billions a year have been beaten by a bunch of redditor trading from home in their pajamas pose an unconfortable question for them why do wealthy people need hedge funds if hedge funds can be beaten so easily why pay them outrageous fees see gme investors have put in danger the whole hedge fund business model thats why they are scared hedge funds went full retard for the first time in life hedge funds are reacting to what retail is doing they are not leading anymore they decided to go full retard and short even more once the short squeeze started thinking they could easily beat retail when the trade moved against them they just cried and change the rules of the game the fact that they have lost several times and have no way out is huge because it means they cannot bring any value to their investors again making their business model crumble they have the weaker hand they tried to use all kind of scary tactics cnbc spreading misinformation about shorts depicting wsb as a bunch of people gambling randomly bloomberg yahoo finance and many more sites trying to prevent the short squeeze etc they may have even commited fraud collusion and market manipulation after what happened on thursday and friday yet gme investors held the line why because they know hedge funds have the weak hand everyday they are losing money on their shorts paying interests while investors just have to hold the stock there is no hurry in selling no pressure and everyday new investors join the party pushing the price higher for how many days are they going to keep preventing people from buying they cannot do anything they may try to close this sub but it is not possible why because it would be so obvious that they are doing it because they are losing money that twitter and youtube would burn and this would backfire up to the government they may try to prevent retail traders from using leverage products but that would drain liquidity of options and futures markets and cause potential capital flows into other markets foreign equity markets defi etc if they keep manipulating price and preventing retail from buying the same applies capital would flow to other markets so the whole us financial industry would suffer tldr hold if you like the stock better buy the stock than weekly calls hedge funds are fucked gme investors will make history

587,173,2021-01-31 07:58:46,great dd from rgme credit goes to uquiqsllver probably the most important thing you can read regarding gme ampx200b processing img qq1cm0figie61 logically it made sense that robinhood was running out of capitol until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements first we examine the brokerages finances td ameritrade 2019 average 860000 trades per day 11 million accounts and 1 trillion in net assets held by clients data limited no ipo robinhood 2020 13 million accounts 43 million trades $150 billion in transactions etrade 2019 3986 billion retail assets 365 billion corporate service assets morgan stanley purchased etrade to have a combined 31 trillion in assets in addition morgan stanley had 38947 billion in free cash flow for 2019 charles schwab 2020 669 trillion in client assets averaged 8191 million trades per day etoro 2020 15 trillion trade value cleared in a year or 4109 billion per day 17 million users ampx200b next lets examine gme volume ampx200b on monday and tuesday 25012021 ddmmyyyy was at 177 million $100 a share 91 million wednesday $350 a share and finally 42 million on thursday high of 470 and average at 240 this adds up to 177 billion traded value monday and tuesday 3185 billion traded value wednesday 1008 billion thursday stick with me here now remember these companies are used to trading $gme at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 billion traded value so in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day and that is the numbers we are working with now compare this to tesla this year they experienced an average volume of 3476 million however their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million a share price of 41713 compared to the highest on the year at 22213 million shares traded a price of $695 those two numbers add up to 7091 billion on their lowest day and 15438 billion on their highest now remember how we just saw that on $gme highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion yet somehow we see etoro robinhood charles schwab etrade and td ameritrade all restrict $gme because as they claim they ran out of money so they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but cant cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks now you tell me were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they arent a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood who passes the homeless man talks to the single mother works 12 hour shifts we were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80 for admin cost but to you me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a friday night but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute keep your head up the math on this is simple they are playing you tldr these brokerages are full of bs and scared as fuck not a financial advice
205,89,2021-01-31 07:39:09,melvin capital still isnt out or it doesnt matter either way mods if this is just a parrot of someone elses dd feel free to take it down i read wsb for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time disclaimer im a moron and not a financial expert i own gme shares this is all my opinion hello my fellow retards this gme movement has been seriously heartening for the common man and the following that wsb has gained because of it is completely bonkers this is all well and good but on some level gme is still a numbers game to me melvin announced that it had closed its position in gme and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim i have some 8 pm coffeefueled napkin math that suggests maybe point 1 here is a website ive found very confirmation biasy it gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day over the last 10 days we see a short volume of approximately 200m that is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for melvin to have exited their short at first glance at least if we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 122 through 126 there is approximately 82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range then from 127 to 129 after gme broke $300 there is 34m short volume if we assume that every single short got out then bought back in as the price rose for the last 80m volume to ultimately bring us to the si estimate today the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding on average is about $180 per short in other words shorts are still massively underwater even if theyve been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week point 2 cnbc could be lying point 3 cnbc could be telling the truth this article mentions what a few experts yes shkreli is an expert here have said at this point watch the interest rate if melvin exited their position as fast as they could and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack the interest rate would fall through the floor i am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month but melvin having probably the single largest short position on gme would definitely shake up the numbers edit u_udw mentioned that ihor dusaniwsky also disagreed with the possible melvin exit point 4 the devils advocate melvin as per the cnbc article completely exited its position on 126 that tuesday was two things the cleanest rising day weve had since $35 and some of the highest volume gme has ever seen in my opinion that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as melvin unwinded their position and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without completely fucking the price my conclusions melvin being out or not isnt a huge deal but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone i am positive that a multibilliondollar hedge fund would rather book a 30 year loss than a bankruptcy and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman however at this point someone is still holding a 100 bag at least and these new shorts entering gme then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up trcr melvin is probably lying but it doesnt matter buy gme rocket emoji

0,208,2021-01-31 07:32:26,yes keep buying gme but i think mac could blow up thoughts welcome wrote this for another sub but maybe people here can tell me if im fullon retarded or just partially retarded hold gme do not sell buy the dips gme has not popped im writing this only because its a smaller $ value trade and some of you may be able to put a tiny amount in and get some food for your 9 children or at least start paying child support loser i know a lot of you fuckers are already in mac and we can make another round of people rich note i have a $1k stock position in mac so this isnt a big money maker for me since i didnt buy call options but im going to i just want to share what ive found and how i see things so hopefully we can have another round of poors becoming wealthy during this fucked up pandemic why i think mac is such a hold position is because look at the short interest it has been at or near 70 for a long time and the short interest is dropping see graph on imgur slide why i think this is important is because mac was trading around $6 a year ago i think a lot of shorts are already trapped at the low prices probably shorts at really low prices that cant get out because the current price thats my logic at least someone with more market knowledge please let me know if thats not the correct way to think about things also i think mac has been collecting rent and has good financialscash like gme so it is undervalued can someone grab a good article so we can lay out the value play on mac macs market cap is a lot bigger 5xs that of where gamestop was at i think this may make it harder to squeeze but someone with more knowledge can maybe chime in thoughts and help appreciated and if im totally idiotic you can tell me that too edit one other thought mac is a good shortterm and longterm play if you look at options theyre really cheap now go look at the 5 day chart see how the stock has been bouncing off $23 if you buy the cheapest february call options i think you can easily make it to $23 and i think theres a possibility for a lot of $$$$$ to be had i cant trade options right now because its taking forever to get money into my trading account oh yeah i never traded until gme and ive never traded options so again im a retard but dfv made the majority of his money on calls so if one of you fuckers strike it rich on the option at least leave me a thumbs up on here dont buy reddit medals put it in gme edit gathering here rmacarmybets
60,60,2021-01-31 07:31:49,an alternative to transferring brokerages and potentially missing the squeeze robinhood cash account update if you are getting a 404 error i recommend contacting their support and requesting they downgrade your account to a robinhood cash account i dont think this is nefarious ive seen this 404 error since at least november update 2 robinhood makes money lending out your shares to shorts and they keep the interest if you switch to a robinhood cash account they will be unable to lend out your shares a ton of this sub uses robinhood and after what happened the last few days we all want to jump ship not only did robinhood restrict buying of gme but since we are all on margin accounts technically robinhood owns the stock and simply passes many of the rights of ownership to us crediting us with quasiownership this is important because if robinhood fails we dont actually own our stocks robinhood does and those shares we paid a lot for could just as well go byebye the obvious solution is to get the fuck off robinhood but it aint that simple if you begin a transfer of your assets to another brokerage your positions will be frozen for up to 2 weeks every single day counts right now and that is simply not an option as much as we shit on robinhood we really need to be rooting for them to succeed and get an influx of cash to be able to post it as collateral with dtcc to get our trading activity back to normal all that being said there is an alternative solution to save our asses robinhood cash accounts details here click meeeee in short when you sign up for robinhood you start off with a robinhood instant account this is a margin account if youre like many of the retards on here you upgraded it to a robinhood gold account this is still a margin account there is a third option a robinhood cash account you do not get access to instant deposits you do not get access to instant settlements if you sell anything youd need to wait 2 trading days before having access to the cash essentially youre no longer relying on the magic of margin accounts to make everything look instantaneous to you does that suck yeah kinda but you get full control and ownership of your shares i will be downgrading my account to a robinhood cash account and once this is all over ill be transferring to another brokerage
91,28,2021-01-31 07:29:35,as soon as they quit shorting well quit buying current fundamentals and ta say buy hows that sound cramer et al dont be fooled they are spreading misinformation to try and fold as many hands as possible there is no way out for them except major losses or prison some are deciding this weekend which choice they will make id like to see someone do some real ta and analysis on the actual value of gme with all of this free marketing support etc tech companies are often huge valuation with no product and the cronies seem to have no issue with that
213,54,2021-01-31 07:27:12,just got done listening to cnbc explaining why short selling is so important to our markets tldr by holding our bang stonks with we are doing to the hedge funds what they do to good stonks i work for a retailer not gme and about 8 years ago the short sellers came a knocking they blasted us daily saying retail is dead full blown media attack to change public opinion shitty practice they drove the stock from $60s down to under $10 they made their money and thousands of employees were laid off today the stock is over $100 cnbc shills say that short sellers keep the market honest to prevent poor idiots from losing their life savings to madoff bull shit those same funds were all in bed with that scum bag and only went short after it became public that he was a douche they are in it for profit and nothing else keep pressure on them and keep buying no way they unloaded yet but what do i know im a retard that knows nothing about the stock market
57,98,2021-01-31 07:21:11,can shorts actually afford to pay out a moass situation lets discuss how this actually plays out the impact on the broader market and some alternative plays spy puts i am trying to think through this gme squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets i have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this moass should happen i have a full grasp of the concept ive been in it since november my biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious monster squeeze goes down and should those of us with other holdings be buying spy puts as a hedge or as a cheaper correlated moass play how do we get our money in the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k 5k even saying 30k a share im thinking ok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that i can then take out to buy a house the answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt so first off wouldnt this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell and maybe the situation isnt that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money but then the next leap is if they cant pay then the money comes from who mms and brokers who sold the positions will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that and if so where does that come from the same place of liquidating or if they spend all their dry powder on this doesnt that shake the market basically wouldnt the true ultimate moass crash the stock market am i being crazy here outcomes breakdown that brings me to should we be hedging our other positionssneakily playing the gme squeeze with puts here are some outcomes ive thought through situation 1 i am over stating this shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to they just dont want to or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape loss on puts possible loss on gme situation 2 we are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a tslalike melt up people continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term small dip in spy and gme is a slow tendie cooker situation 3 squeeze happens soon and violently hedges fire sale to cover there is an immediate medium but short market dip situation 4 hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the moass and still have a ton left to cover money has to come from elsewhere funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt chaos and loss of confidence in the markets large market dipactual financial crisis and my least favorite situation 5 if its true the moass would crash the market and thats why they blocked it from happening this week wont they shut down the market before they let it happen in this scenario they close the market for the day get the shorts to agree with gme management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford then tell all of us get fucked you dont deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy gme goes down to its real value gme management gets billions to work with maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse spy life goes on long term hold so not an absolute disaster but ouch lots of anger as a last thought if someone smarter than me steps in and says yes its true there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1kshare outstanding and that is totally where we are going does that change our strategy because isnt it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an iou for 20kshare that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt robinhood and a class action suit that goes nowhere plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real open to any discussion on this end game tldr would a moass crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere and if so should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through spy puts lastly if that is the case we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen and how they would actually handle it not financial advice positions 272 gme shares 2 spy put 370 feb 3
11,30,2021-01-31 07:18:41,sideline autist question about short interest over 100 can the same share be short sold more than once i have been reading all the dd about the gme short interest being more than the entire float of the stock the main explanation given for how that comes is naked shorts what i want to understand is whether the same actual share can be sorted multiple times for simplicity lets assume no one has instructed their broker not to lend their shares lets take an example where we have a long gme b short gme c wants to buy gme d wants to short gme a has bought 1 gme share as broker has lent the share to b to short sell it c buys the 1 share in gme c has no idea that the share they are buying was sold to them by a short seller can cs broker now lend that share to d to short it if not why not forgetting any philosophical position around short selling overall c has paid full price for a share they should be able to make money by lending it and what technical mechanism prevents this if yes how are issues like voting and dividends dealt with there is only one share but now two people own it that doesnt magically create 2 votes and 2 dividends edit we like the stock i thought that went without saying also this is not financial advice because it is a question mainly
434,141,2021-01-31 07:17:52,message to future paper hands when we finally see gme there will be paper hands who will sell at some price points on the way most of them will be unretarded gme holders who are holding most of gme floats right now and dont share our love for the stock some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college some of them may be you whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember while it is important stock goes up it is even more important stock doesnt go all the way down this will keep flying as long as it doesnt hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts this means that even when gme drops at some point as long as it doesnt drop low enough for hedges to cover the fuel will keep coming there is an easy way to keep this up if at any point you fuck up and sell stock put down a lower buy order at the same time as far as we know hedges need to cover shorts at the $320 range if gme rockets to $1000 for example and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000 immediately put down a buy order above $320 that way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up if everyone who sells puts a buy order at a price point the stock cannot fall below that price point i have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month maybe you retards crash the world economy maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit i dont think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $ there are too many of you retards who have bought up gme locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key in normal stocks when price falls people panic and sell until there is nothing left you retards dont know how to sell and there is way too many of you also i dont fucking know what im talking about i bought my first stock yesterday this is not financial advice im just a retard if you listen to me youre an even bigger retard tldr buy gme hold gme if buy gme again hold gme

152,122,2021-01-31 06:35:35,the real short squeeze catalyst 4q earnings the sole reason to hold gme longer than next week and next month are the 4q earnings according to yahoo finance gamestop is scheduled to report between 2429 of march why wait until then easy usually short squeeze happens when there is a catalyst like acquisition a new product announcement or a surprise earning report gme probably not going to buy or get bought out by someone and they wont announce a new product but they will announce earnings 2 months from now that has a great chance to surprise everyone what do we know so far about their upcoming earnings we only have information about their holiday sales 48 increase in comparable stores sales yoy and 296 growth qoq 309 increase in ecommerce sales representing 34 of total sales reaching $135b total sales declined 31 driven by an 11 decrease in the company store base australia and new zealand sales increase 31 basically gamestop closed 11 of the company stores and still total sales were down a minor 31 while comparable sales increased 48 this means 2 things 1 physical stores are still profitable or performing very well 2 ecommerce sales are now making up for the loss of sales of closed stores leading the way for ecommerce being the main company revenue stream 3 covid free countries like australia and new zealand are still buying from gamestop helping it penetrate these huge markets gme on the 3q report said that they expect positive comparable sales which we just saw are probably going to be positive and finally being profitable the key here is profitability gme was profitable only 3 times in the last 12q in the last 2q that gme achieved profitability the stock went up 27320 was the day of announcement the stock gapped up a whopping 16 before going down 11619 was another profitable q announcement the stock gapped up 85 after earnings why is it matter well if the next earning report will be a good surprise we will see the price move up the next day and if the company will show a clear path of profitability for the next years the short thesis will be gone and a short squeeze will follow the odds of profitability are very high with the management expecting it and ecommerce sales booming i conclusion hold till earnings dont sale tldr the squeeze will happen when there will be a catalyst the only catalyst for gme is earnings at the end of march so hold tight until then and lets get the moneyyyyy this is not financial advice do you own dd positions 141 stocks at 14$ average price edit imho these earnings are not regular earnings they are going to talk about profitability and hopefully give guidance to after covid because of the vaccines that give hope for the retailers but imo the most important thing that can come out of this is if they will say that ecommerce is still rising and is a clear revenue growth stream when this will happen the short thesis will vanish and shorts will admit their lose untill then i believe hf can stay under water and pay the fees unless an early catalyst will emerge im holding until earnings if the squeeze wont squaze
279,85,2021-01-31 06:35:08,stop shilling for the brokers shutting down trading they are lying to us the entire purpose of the trading restrictions imposed the past few days was to fuck retail traders over full stop they may use any formal excuse they have such as the clearing houses mandated they stopped or something else but that is not why they did what they did they knew that this would allow the hedge funds to manipulate the stock and shake out paper hands they did this to fuck over retail traders and save themselves and the hedge funds if their concern was the clearing houses these stocks would have had trading halted completely for their account holders because they would have known that hedge funds were going to be limit hunting with zero resistance against them stop pretending they didnt just rob all of us also gme is the only good short squeeze candidate as it is the only stock with a short interest higher than the float everything else is a trap
285,75,2021-01-31 06:19:15,i am a writer and podcaster when this is all said and done i want our story to be told accurately i dont know if im the right guy for the job but i will do everything i can to capture the nuances of the story details we arent seeing on the news like the fact that this all started because dfv actually liked the stock the fact that people on here have made millions and wont sell so that people who have made 4 or 5 figures and need that money can sell and pay their bills the fact that hedge funds are laddering to manipulate the price that the entire market is overvalued with and our gme trades are exposing the corruption on wall street id need your guys help in making sure i dont miss anything clutch and would post drafts on here before putting it on to my channels to make sure there is a consensus that the story is being told accurately is this a dumb idea or is it something i should pursue edit per request i am posting the name of our podcast i didnt want to post it because i didnt want to act like i am trying to get free publicity but the podcast is called redacted if you want to know dm me i dont want free publicity and it is a selfhelp podcast for men however our audience look to us to talk about what is going on in the world and i am more than happy to hijack the channel for this story especially since we have bee light on putting out content the past several months that and my cohost suggested i talking about this on the show anyways more importantly if we can get a little crew together to write this story we can spread it wider than to just our 3000 listeners or whatever our audience is these days we can organize this information to create what we consider to be an accurate portrayal of these events edit 2 redcated my podcast name as i want to ensure that i am not doing this for free publicity i dont really see the point in posting it here for now maybe if enough people ask but for now you can dm me if you want to know the name edit 3 if you would like to help here are the main links that i think would help the most right now the best dd posts dfvs initial comments on why he liked the stock from back in 2019 posts of people who need the money cashing out and saying what they spent it on student loans medical bills etc screenshots with evidence of the hfs market manipulation screenshots of robinhood and other trading platforms gme halts
291,178,2021-01-31 06:14:22,next big dick play fuck rh robinhood app stole from the poor and gave to the rich gave some lame excuse about capital requirements while hfs drive the prices down and were allowed to repurchase them at a discount while we watch from the side lines fights still not over si of float is still over 113 gme rh is planning to ipo this quarter it would be a shame if rhs loses its userbase to a different platform beforewhen it goes public if news comes out that rh is losing their customer base their shares will plummet feed them to the hfs they tried to protect rh can restrict selling all they want it wont save them edit rh sells their order flows from their users to the big players on wallstreet if rh has no users they have nothing to sell they become worthless
80,207,2021-01-31 06:00:58,unpopular opinion what if they screw us can we imagine a scenario if they can get along with this  none of what is below is financial advice do your own research and risk management tldr the hedge funds and the lawmakers could find a way to get around the law and screw us they always have and they always will they have much more means that we do and only from a probabilistic point of view we will lose can we imagine a scenario where this could happen x200b i know that what i about to say sounds bearish i own my part of gme shares since before the first gamma squeeze and i have now pretty nice gains as many of us do i agree on the possibility for the price to reach astronomical limits due to the short squeeze in theory it could work in theory you think that because this is the weekend everything stopped and will resume on monday like nothing happened no right now the hedge funds executives and all their management boards are certainly working on a solution to make legal what happened last week they are right now trying to find a way to take your shares from you and for this they will have the help of many people people which can be at a very high level of our society and after this will happen we will be the one accused of having manipulated the market and you all know they have near unlimited means to do so they have the money they have politics they have the hardware power they have everything you got a taste of it last week with that huge bots attack on reddit and how they managed to manipulate the market so far we have the shares and we got them legally in all transparency with our own and hardly earned money and we have the absolute right to buy some more at the price we want and to sell them at the price we want sure the shares thats what they want but what if they find the legal way to take it from you and worst than that to take them from you without giving you back at least your initial investment this sounds extreme but this is what happened in 2008 they took your money and your houses without giving you anything back the hedge funds were protected by politics to big to fail they said well this week they failed for a second time what will they do now sorry to say this but most probably the same thing so do you guys have an idea how they could manage to skirt the law or bypass it i do not live in the us so i do not know how they could do this if someone has an idea please share it below x200b i felt i had to write this because since last week and especially since last friday the number of people reading reddit and especially wsb increased more than exponentially many people want to join this financial fight many of them are young i hope more than 18 at least many of them are maybe putting themselves in danger so i just wanted to suggest you to think twice before investing all your life savings for this noble cause will you be in financial danger if they manage to take all your investment from you how would you live with this would you still be able to pay your bills taxes and bring food on the table just take a moment to think about this there is a hight probabillity to lose it all on this personally i have a broad portfolio if this happens i would certainly lose a certain percentage of it it will take some time to build it again sure but i will not be in immediate danger so does melvin co if they lose some more billions by trying to take the price down in vain in theory they will continue this practice until they really start to feel what it looks like to be in danger maybe for the first time of their lives this is why i will hold my shares because i bought them legally and i have the right to sell them at whatever the fucking price i want i will hold because it is legally mine and also i just like the stock it is doing great for me recently i just felt i had to write this to show to all lurkers media and all that wsb is not only a forum where we yolo our savings unconsciously we are also people who know how to manage our risks and who care about each other $gme 
82,131,2021-01-31 05:47:01,explanation of why robinhood really restricted buys of gamestop edit first off i am not a robbinghood sympathiser as some of the comment claim fuck robbing hood diamond hands at $31630 baby here is a video from louis rossmann explaining it x200b this is for all of those who dont understand why robin hood trading 212 and all the other brokers restricted buying of $gme and $amc the levels to a share purchase of a share are as follows brokerhedgefund clearing house dtcc broker robinhood t212 etc they are simply a platform to allow people to buy and sell shares on an app hedge funds are also at this level but obviously dont need a broker like retail investors do x200b clearing house they provide the dtcc with collateral usually 1 to 3 for 2 days which can be called upon in case the brokerhedge fund cannot pay dtcc to settle the trade trades are settled 2 days after the transaction takes place at dtcc level if the broker cannot pay up to legally settle the trades 2 days later the clearing house is on the hook and has to pay up to dtcc because of the volatility and risk of market wide collapse with trades not being able to be cleared with cash dtcc required that clearing houses put up 100 collateral this removes risk that the seller of a stock might not get paid cash x200b dtcc they are the guys who replace the old paper exchange of share ownership they handle like 95 of all share exchanges and are responsible to ensure the market does not collapse collapse in this case is if a seller does not get paid when they sell a share this would happen for every stock on the market due to clearing houses not having the money to pay up now why could you sell but not buy surely the brokers are manipulating the stock to drive the price down this is because when you buy a stock all of the above has already taken place dtcc is happy that the money is in place in case the stock is sold then when you sell gme you get paid because the clearing house has already guaranteed the funds to dtcc they stopped buying so that the risk of sale default is minimised in my opinion the brokers fucked up even though they can allow selling of the stock they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by only allowing selling they should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds so what did robinhood do wrong essentially robinhood fucked up by allowing so much margin and borrowed funds to retail investors they ran out of money to front to the clearing house this is why they limited buys and asked for margin buyers to have 100 cash in the account what about the hedge funds melvin capital fucked up with the short they didnt have enough money to cover their positions and buy the high price cover citadel therefore bailed them out why could i buy $gme the next day clearing houses went to banks to get lending for large sums of money so they can provide dtcc with the necessary collateral that they require this is why the brokers could allow the retail investors to buy the stock again why did some brokers allow us to buy $gme when others didnt different brokers use different clearing houses so while one clearing house locked off a broker the other clearing house may have been fine and not done the calculations yet thats why there was kind of a juggling situation between brokers allowing buys and restricting buys on friday t212 did not restrict buys for cash on gme but they completely restricted cfd on it this is because they couldnt front the leverage themselves or through their clearing house tldr i know we degens dont want to believe it but the brokers did not have a choice in this the clearing houses told the brokers to stop the buying because they didnt have the money to guarantee that you get paid if you sell restricting buying and only allowing selling did result in a manipulation of the stock price but that wasnt the main reason behind the clearing houses forcing the brokers to stop the buying in my opinion the brokers fucked up even though they can allow selling of the stock they must have known that it would drive down the price of the stock by only allowing selling they should have blocked selling as well as buying until the clearing houses found the funds

162,75,2021-01-31 05:24:40,the narrative youll hear is that robinhood placed limits on certain orders to mitigate your risk we all know thats bullshit but why do we know thats bullshit well if youre new to investing theres a concept called margin margin is essentially a line of credit given by brokerages to users to trade with they still own whatever you buy with it but youre allowed to take profits on how you use it paying them back with interest once youve made gains if youre not making gains theyll sell your stuff for you and youll be responsible for making up the loss a while back people in financial circles were freaking out because of the influx of you inexperienced investors trading on margin thinking it could cause a crash from reckless investing of course thats not true because the retail investor is on the hook for these losses what might bring down the market is institutional investors utilizing some of the strategies that they said uninformed retail investors would do its hypocrisy incarnate youre on the hook for your margin losses or any cash losses theyre trying to get hedge funds off the hook for theirs heres the thing though almost anyone could get an absolute shitload of margin unemployed college students and $40kyear average people were given thousands often tens of thousands dollars of credit to trade with these are essentially loans that they know very few people will actually benefit from loans your bank would never give you rh didnt give a shit because they dont give a shit about your risk once people realized buying gme with their own cash was a sure fire way to make money they started caring about your risk theyre not limiting your risk theyre limiting your gains that youd earn at the expense of hedge funds that pay them for your trading data risk with a high likelihood of downside have at it risk with almost surefire insanely high upside were gonna have to step in edit to add yes theres also the probably more impactful reality that they likely didnt have the capital they needed to facilitate these trades my main point is that its sure as hell not to minimize your risk

162,172,2021-01-31 04:28:50,some aapl dd for you retards alright retards and autists listen up aapl earnings were last week and they were spectacular sales up 21 yoy smashed 100 billion in revenue in one quarter for the first time ever at 1114 billion sales in all product categories are up double digit percentage points and bassicaly crushed the revenue estimates for every one of their product categories aside from being under by 001 for mac revenue mac revenue still up 21 yoy earnings per share were at $168 vs the estimated $141 its also important to note that sales in china hong kong and taiwan are up 57 but what happened you ask like a wide eyed retard fresh outta mommies cunt weve all seen this shit before blowout earning report and a steep sell off straight afterwards its why only the retardiest of retards play earnings they almost always recover after said sell off and if you look at the chart apple is prime for a swift recovery judging by the extremely bullish batman throwing a batarang pattern that developed in the last few hours on friday the reason i believe the recovery will be swift is because this sell off was almost certainly caused by a few big funds needing liquidity to cover their gme shorts short more gme also autists liquidating their positions to buy more gme this dip will be bought right back up by institutions that have no interest in gme tldr aapl going back over 140 by the end of next week cuz i said so postions aapl feb 05 140c aapl mar 05 145c

this this wont apply to most of you but it probably applies to some of you alright morons listen up law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while there are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are or have been making moves with gmethe other meme stocks right now these issues range from civil to criminal so you should probably read this ill put a tldr at the bottom if words are hard for you ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ first of all i am not an attorney yet and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all you should talk to a real lawyer if you think you might need legal advice more on that below im going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things ive seen on wsb as of late and if it sounds like you go talk to a lawyer the opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets christine souhrada securities fraud market manipulation and the internet ucla jl tech 2002 at notes 28 what that means in tendiespeak is that the sec can come after you for some combination of your posts comments and trades this doesnt mean they will just that they can note the sec has an office of internet enforcement just because this is rwallstreetbets and the memes are good youre not immune from realworld problems the sec is not the only source of potential problems they coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies im not going to explain the law procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you because im fond of you but not that fond also like i mentioned above you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesnt rise to the level of criminal the key to what the sec calls market manipulation is causing enough investors to buy the target companys stock by disseminating false information to artificially inflate the stock price id see the abovereferenced legal journal thats what id means this also applies to artificially deflating by disseminating false information if you hold a short position or a put etc this is the apparent business model of funds like melvin and yes they should be the ones being looked at but should doesnt matter and im writing this for you not them if youve gotten caught up in the hype and memes and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon gme you need to talk to a lawyer now i cant tell you if what youve said is false or not but a real lawyer can the lynchpin of liability tendiespeak whether you have a problem on your hands is the making of

predicting that a companys stock prices would rise to at least s1500 yet selling his stock for a third of the price which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws therefore promoter engaged in securities fraud despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his

2037,583,2021-01-31 19:58:44,dd about melvin closing their position  tldr looks like melvin did close their position but it wouldnt affect the squeeze dd i dug up melvin sec filing and saw that they have 54m gme shares put in sep an increase from 34m shares in june most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7m in december but i doubt they have a much larger position than that melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 0127 gmes price on 0127 is $360 so it cost them about $2b to $25b to cover this matches the bail they got from citadel also lb one of melvins top holdings had a violent dip on 0127 this could mean melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover melvin has another sec filing due feb 14 for december so we will have a better idea about their number s3 reports that short interest reduced by 5m shares on 0127 this matches with the shares melvin covered this means there are still 58m shares that are not yet covered what we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we i dont think that many of these are new short positions because 1 shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment 2 hedge funds tend to target low risk high roi stocks this means easycheap to short shares with negative sentimental bottom line hold on tight because were gonna go for quite a ride my price target $20k not a financial advice just why i like the stock

54,194,2021-01-31 15:39:28,potential endgame scenario gamestop issues some shares and negotiates the best price on our behalf so this started with me being worried that gamestop would issue shares to melvin at a price of their choosing and walk away with billions leaving us holding the bag or at least prevent the short squeeze but thats just the thing while they do want to use this opportunity to better capitalize they dont want to piss us off after what is currently happening to robinhood ipo nope solvency well see so how does gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly heres my idea if the short interest is 120 of shares gamestop issues an amount of shares representing only that additional 20 and you may say why negotiate a price because gamestop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders many of us included so they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500share $30 billion to the books while allowing all of us to realize those same gains but what about the squeeze thats the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze future interest etc would have cost and it would be factored into the negotiated price thoughts holes additions position 16 shares gme diamond handed edit im being told my example of 20 is way too high for what gamestop is actually able to issue if anyone is able to explain why they couldnt get more authorized or what the maximum value they could issue is ill update my bad typed it on desktop edit 2 general responses have been outside of me being a corporate shill that gamestop can only issue $100m worth of shares now which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more the other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term

190,50,2021-02-01 16:31:52,gme original analysis and thesis for why i bought in at $13 evernote link for better formatting thesis with the advent of online gaming and esport gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post covid the support of ryan cohen a ecommerce marketing guru has brought hope to a oncebeloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality the stock is also enticing because of its 138 short interest which is the highest percentage in the market thus a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for just the short squeeze opportunity nbsp background gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period they made their profits by rebuying used gamesgaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly they relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change the low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was gamestops turn with a boost from covid investors wrote gamestop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $25 dollar results hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them betting on their demise like all the others the funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise could this be manipulation if a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite they could very possibly bankrupt a company how did gamestop survive for so long even though they werent raking in ecommerce profit they were still profitable it was just that that profit stream was shrinking the profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores as they closed unprofitable stores they were able to offset cost slightly investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and dec 2020 couldnt come quicker gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs they were not valued for growth anymore so they werent in a situation to raise capital risk free they have several billions in shortterm and longterm debt but they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with lastly the nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever gamestop rode the tailend of nintendo success all through 2020 with switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments the turnaround a new management team had join in august 2019 that set to slim down the company they were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores a comprehensive turnaround plan called gamestop reboot was announced with 4 elements 1 optimized the core business reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works 2 become the social cultural hub for gaming turning gamestop into a experience center and not just a store 3 build a frictionless digital ecosystem revamp the supply chain to be ecommerce focused 4 transform vendor partnership rekindle and make new partnerships like all new managements this one needed time but unfortunately covid complicated the plans investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish however they had underestimated the future of gaming the first significant move was bringing reginald filsaimé onto the board of directors reginald was known for his market prowess bring nintendo to what it is today investors loved that as covid happened working from home and home entertainment exploded logitech corsair bestbuy exploded online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and covid had shorten this timeline online gaming took off activision electronic arts zynga tencent all exploded apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage one notable company that changed in valuation was logitech they were a value company but relabeled to growth what was missing from this list was gamestop the bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited if there was hope of a gme turnaround their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher pe multiples it was only fair the next big event that occurred was in october 2020 gamestop announced a partnership with microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan investors started to give the company a second look microsoft partnership caused shares to rally 30 in a day a bullish sign that the big players havent given up however this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership only that for every microsoft xbox console that gamestop sells going forward gamestop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download dlc microtransaction and any subscriptions as well to me this sounds very bullish that microsoft still believes in gamestop next came news that the wellrespected businessmen ryan cohen released that he had bought up 13 of gamestop shares becoming a minority owner ryan cohen was the founder of chewy a petsmart online branch that outcompeted amazon investors labeled him an ecommerce gurugenius he had bought shares at $481 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased rumors started speculating that cohen would takeover and transform gamestop and it was materialized when cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter gamestops leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidlygrowing gaming sector gamestop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brickandmortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem it was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover the letter was sent three weeks before q3 earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a cohen reference during the earning call er came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil company performance wise they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations the expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped the stock would have soared had not an offering been announce offering dilutes shares so instead gme dropped 17 from the conference calls many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of ryan and piled on to the shorts a week later a filing by ryan cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $1483 this news rekindled the speculation that ryan cohen was going to do a takeover stock bounced and soared to $2235 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $1735 jan 2021 the first squeeze shorts were still convinced that gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130 some short sellers had left while new ones piled on monday jan 11th gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short first with an announcement that there was 309 increase in ecommerce sales from 2019 holiday season 48 increase in comparable store sales 31 decrease in total sales the biggest takeaway was that their new ecommerce strategy was working 309 increase is massive also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core rise in sales of profitable store was also shown the closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight they slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit this was super bullish secondly a board of advisor switch up was announced ryan cohen and two main chewy guys were hopping on replacing 3 other people ryan essentially brought chewy management to gamestop they know have 13 of the companys vote gme management knew that a takeover was happening hostile or not and so they opened the doors they also expanded ryan cohens ability to buy up to 20 of the total shares permit and hestia capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 59 majority result even with the news the stock price stayed range bound at 205 and volume was extremely low for that monday and tuesday shorts were once again depressing the price however wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls the stock soared this catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally the analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation

299,137,2021-02-01 13:50:09,gme contract volume expiring on feb 5th is around 46k 800 strike price alone has 167k volume i think hfs are selling a bunch of shorts again no doubt brokerages will try to limit buying to keep the price below 800 but if you get to 450 then 500 then 600 that might trigger another squeeze which will send gme to fucking andromeda 450 500 600 has peak volume over 2k contracts for each of those strikes with low volume in between if my memory serves others can confirm if i got those strikes right gme
183,130,2021-02-01 13:43:40,just buy the stock or sell your itm gme calls before they expire the gamma squeeze pushed the price up a bit last week as a result of mms buying gme shares to sell to you when your itm call gets exercised this just occurred to me that many of you may have had gme calls expire itm and you now hold 100 200 300 etc shares and have a margin call on your account your broker will sell those shares for you swiftly and that is perfectly legal this could cause gme to fall quite a bit since the gamma squeeze was the result of mms having to buy those shares you now own and are being forced to sell lastly if the price does drop tomorrow because of this very possible and real scenario do not sell or gtfo edit not a financial advisor im an idiot
148,45,2021-02-01 13:24:45,alright heres a sports analogy for you apes that might like sports but are still struggling to understand whats happening with $gme this might get deleted i know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and dds but im hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand gme and the squeeze thats happening and will be unique enough to stay if youre still struggling to understand the squeeze shorting and the $gme trends im here to help bear with me no not that bear this is gonna be really oversimplified but be different than and so imagine a college star up and coming high draft pick most sports are apt for this analogy but nfl works best this is a qb projected 1 preseason hes legit bonafide undeniable talent lets call him game stop stop 69 hes on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 bad team pandemic limits games played falling off the radar now lets a few things happen 1 someone makes a massive bet that game stop is washed terrible and will never recover but they have to borrow money to make that bet they hate the player because theyre old and resentful and afraid of death and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding they want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail 2 a new head coach gets hired someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in game stop and revolutionize and evolve their game 3 a random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player game stop they think to themselves hey ive seen that dude play his talent is undeniable and hes got the perfect new coach there is no way hes gonna be that bad 4 this dude lets his buddies know about how high the bet against the player game stop is and they agree there is no way theyre that bad especially with the new coach theres no way this bet can win this is easy money 5 word about the bet spreads like wildfire not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is they realize how insane the bet against him is now game stop 69 starts to get back on track they start playing games again and show their potential their talent theyre making a playoff run now theyre gaining more and more attention and more people realize theyre gonna succeed the original person who bet against the player who was convinced they were washed starts to panic the person they borrowed the money from is starting to see whats going on and starts to ask for the money back every game that game stop plays they prove themselves more and more and the bet against them gets even more spicy at this point the bettor borrows even more money and doubles down stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right people arent having it theyve seen the games they know the talent there is absolutely no way this player isnt legit no possible way for them to fail they bet even more in support they know hell succeed make the playoffs and win the championship and be the 1 pick at this point the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money there is no way they can pay back the original bet theyll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed somehow they have enough power to stop the player from playing games they take the games off tv they delete the highlight videos they go to the news screaming this player is terrible trash washed anyone who doesnt believe that is delusional wrong and will lose a lot of money it doesnt matter everyone has already seen the games the highlights the talent with their own eyes its undeniable the bet is terrible and the new coach fits perfectly every single day the bettor doesnt cut his losses the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe theyre getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall but if they wanna continue thats fine the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end thats where were at now exactly that all it comes down to now is all of us believing what weve already known what weve already seen they can take down the videos they can blackout the media they can keep them from even playing a game but its too late weve seen it we know we know the talent the coach and how bad the bet is all we have to do is believe in ourselves and trust in the talent weve seen and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was every moment that goes by every game they play the bet gets worse and our position gets better no matter what the original better has to call it quits and take their losses but they will do everything they can to make us stumble falter fear to make us doubt ourselves and what weve seen what we know they cant we watched this player in elementary school in middle school in high school and college they brought us countless moments of joy and sometimes of sadness we lost with them but more importantly we won with them how fucking dare someone bet against them and their talent and intentionally try to ruin their career just out of spite to make a profit we know this player we trust this player we like this player we believe in this player and if we hold this player by fucking god this player and everyone who believed in them will win well succeed and that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them they lose everything

178,142,2021-02-01 11:14:10,americans taxes on tendies have been seeing a lot of posts on taxes without details on whatwhere you owe and confused apes in the comments here are the basics not a professional cpa just someone offering some basic advice if you are trading in a taxexempt account ira roth ira 401k etc congratulations you dont have to worry about taxes on your tendies at least for now if you are trading in a standard brokerage account keep reading 1 if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days the profit is considered short term capital gains however all cap gainslosses are considered together write off losses against gains example you bought $10k gme jan 1 sold gme in april diamond hands for $1000000 that is $990k profit now if you decided youve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset you owe taxes on the $990k the tax rate will depend on other income you have it is taxed as regular income tax look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single rule of thumb set aside 40 usually will be more than enough example 2 however lets say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in july 2021 sadly your $990k is a total loss congrats you have no net gainslosses you owe no additional taxes example 3 you are even more regarded and gamble your original investment of $10k hoping to make it back you lose that too now that counts as a net loss for the year of $10k well that sucks but at least you can deduct $3k of it from your regular income and carry the other $7k over to be deducted in future years note this does not mean you get $3k back it means if your income is $50k you now get to deduct $3k and pay income tax on $47k 2 now if you bought gme jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in february 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2000 you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes that $2k will be taxed at the longterm cap gains rate for tax year 2022 for 2020 tax year those tax brackets single filers are 0 if your total income is less than $40k 15 for income between 40 and 440k and 20 if over that note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned cas is 1314 please confirm for your state if you have other losses you can write those off against the gains same as before also tip all of this is super easy to do in turbotax turbotax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically its super easy to use even you apes can use it if you have a simple tax situation eg just your tendies and your regular 95 just go with turbotax they also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help 365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this 1 day for stocks ie buy jan 1 2021 sell before jan 2 2022 it is short term edit to add potential state cap gains taxes edit correction on losses edit correction on the correction original post correct
154,185,2021-02-01 10:59:13,why you should leave robinhood because i cant lots of robinhood talk of course heres the dilemma a luckyunlucky few are facing and why you should help i like several others turned a joke yolo into a fortune like $5k to $200k in a few weeks cool and now im stuck if i transfer my shares and options to say fidelity i lose a week where my shares are locked oh ill still be able to watch my stock go up and down in robinhood but i wont be able to sell anything thats normal and not shady its exactly how any broker would handle it and under normal circumstances this wouldnt be an issue but these are obviously not normal times anyone want to lock up their account for the next week and watch what happens unable to do anything no if we hit the moon and everyone sells by friday ill be lucky to get access to my shares the following monday just in time for this thing to come back to earth i could sell everything i have in robinhood but that still takes me out for a few days since the funds need to settle that day plus 2 additional days then i can send the $ to a different broker even if that last part is instant were still talking about over 2 days again anyone want to bet on where well be in 2 days if i sell at $300 and this thing makes it to $700 by tuesday im fucked if i try to buy back in on wednesday and dont forget if i sell my options and shares i give them to the shorts which hurts everyone so what to do well im obviously stuck for now but you can help if youre in robinhood and not in my situation you can leave asap robinhood is restricting buying gme again tomorrow so you cant get it there anyway if you want to buy switch to fidelity or vanguard or someone and buy there on top of that if robinhood is 100 innocent huge leap of faith there we overwhelmed them and they actually do need people to leave so people who remain can buy gme again obviously i wont if this is simply a clearing house issue and they needed funds to be able to settle due to the massive volatility the only thing that helps them is if people stop buying gme on their app and since the whole motto is buy and hold you really shouldnt be using robinhood so again if you can please leave robinhood because i cant edit 
1086,252,2021-02-01 10:44:23,no listen to me it doesnt matter if short interest is above or below 100 of float there is still a bigass short squeeze some folks seem confused about the fact that greater than 100 of gme floated shares are short example here im here to tell you it does not matter whether the short percentage is above or below 100 even 20 of a stock being shorted is a bigass signal that locating enough shares to cover is going to be really hard so lets look at why 100 of shares shorted doesnt matter shorted shares work exactly the same as money multiplication in fractionalreserve banking picture a stock with exactly 1 share in its float and that share is owned by autist a shorter b borrows the share via a broker sells to a buyer c and the buyer c leaves it with the broker the broker loans it out again to another shorter d who sells to another buyer e now there are two people who have shorted b d and the short interest is 200 of the float note also three people think they own the stock and the total shares they own is 300 of the total shares issued by the company it simply does not matter that 100 of the shares are shorted because there are now 200 of the shares in the hands of longs when you count up the total shares held by longs even 1 share is loaned out for a short results in more than 100 of the float are owned by longs so gme has 113 of the float shorted on friday which means 213 is in the hands of longs this is still a very tough scenario to cover tldr gme 
44,96,2021-02-01 09:54:50,how is short interest calculated alright retards put down your fidget spinners and get your dicks out of your hands i got a serious question how do people actually figure out how many outstanding shares of a company are shorted is there some regulation that says that rh or etrade or whoever needs to submit some kind of numbers on all their short orders every eod or is this whole house of cards built on top of some asshole saying man those hedge funds hate gme so much they probably shorted more stock than is outstanding and then some other asshole being like hey guys did you hear short float on gme is 10000 1

74,50,2021-02-01 09:28:10,why retail investors should quit zerocommission platforms right now  what is robinhoods business model the company generates significant income from payments for order flow a common although controversial practice in which a broker receives compensation and other benefits for directing orders to different parties for trade execution robinhood refers to this revenue as rebates from market makers and trading venues while the payments are negligible for small retail trades a company that directs billions of dollars in trades to market makers can earn substantial amounts this means that you are not a customer for robinhood you are the product your trading data even considering it is full of autistic buys and sells is valuable to the big players in the financial world the conflict of interests so considering more than half of robinhoods revenue comes from these big financial companies all directly connected to big hedge funds theres a direct conflict of interest between robinhoods clients going bankrupt and the users of their platform getting rich the gme short squeeze made by retards like you definitely made robinhood suffer pressure from its clients and they decided to pick the big cucks side will retail traders keep trading on zero commission platforms you cant ignore the fact that people are actually retarded so they will continue to use robinhood even tho theres always be a chance that all of this happening again the price of gme only stopped at $400 because most retail investors were trading on robinhood no company should have such a high impact on retail investors if we are really seeking to bet against cucks from wallstreet

40,28,2021-02-01 09:24:15,why did robinhood halt trading on thursday a hypothesis from a fellow autist consider the following timeline once upon a time hedge funds and brokerages decided gme was a dog and is the easiest money theyve ever made and place positions puts betting that the price will go down they placed bets to the tune of 140 of nominal value of all shares outstanding some autists on reddit identify this massive naked short bet and dont feel their beloved gme who they have deep sentimental feelings for is quite the dog its being made out to be and so just for fun start buying the stock and placing call options betting that the price will go up they talk about it on wsb because thats what we do on wsb taking contrary positions is what autists do best they almost will their beloved gamestop to rise it does disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say wtf this cant be happening thats what celebrities said during the great fappening too it still happened the ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making real money wuuuut you can transfer money to robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options how hard can this be people who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing word spreads more join the fray more huge wins loooks fun more and more and more jump in meanwhile in hedgietown things are looking really fucking dire wtf are these autists doing this cant be happening heeelp im melting they watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than robinhood not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible on the wrong side of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on wall street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets doh we done fucked up this time wuuuuuut the ground swell on reddit turns into a tsunami it starts to make the news a strategy coalesces among the autists hey if we hold and dont sell wont the price rise it appears to work hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and havent bathed or shaved in three days they are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers bankers and brokerage principals on wednesday january 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the ceo of a private firm called robinhood holdings an offer is made hedgies hey v great little company you got there it would be a shame if it no longer existed say next monday because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded us financial markets wouldnt you agree rh silence on the line hedgies heres a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening we need you to halt buying on gme on your platform for a few hours can you do that favor for us if you do we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive this will have long term benefits for everyone including you and robinhood we assure you rhso you are saying this is a systemic risk event hedgies yes thats what we are saying rh but what will we tell our account holders hedgies its only for a few hours just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something in exchange for this favor we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company so its a winwin would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay rh a long moment yes okay hedgies done its transferred upon reaching the agreement for the favor hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on gme for the next day betting the stock will go down on thursday they also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a predetermined time on friday betting the price will go up they know after the halt a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will

69,76,2021-02-01 08:46:10,gme blackrock etfs fellow degenerates i keep it shortehhhm i meant long i tried to add some spice so your brain can digest just keep going line by line you can do it i am first of all scared to death that this is going to be removed in a second by autobots yeah these scary guys from transformers which you dont wanna fuck with rather your friends wife to become officially her boyfriend would be interesting to be for once on the other side of the trade oh and if ever this post remains this is no financial advice i have literally no clue what i am talking about and i lost more money than i am ever able to retain even if gme goes to theand i keep my still i want to give it a try as i think there is two things one could include into the discussion which might add perspective first of all i was thinking about the role of blackrock in this for quite a bit i think a number of posts mentioned that they are a large shareholder of gme and that they increased their position for what reason though i came accross this paper just check the first paragraph in short blackrock lends its shares to the short sellers i leave it to you whether this could be relevent or irrelevant i thought it is certainly something to take into account but as i said i am just someone who has no fkn clue about anything maybe there is going to be a discussion around it hence the flair or not second i was thinking about possibilities how one could aquire gamestop shares in different ways just out of pure boredem ofc and realized that rinvesting mindset for once could be the solution who would have thought this is ever going to happen so i went here and was quite surprised to see that some of these etfs have a significant share of gme in them i have no clue how they come up with their particular distribution as i have no clue about how etfs in general work but maybe it allows to acquire indirectly one or two shares not sure who would be stupid enough to do so i am certainly not because i am never ever going to lay in bed with the guys from rinvesting but at least i filled this extra boring long time between friday close and monday bell i am not expecting this to be really something prominently discussed as i am sure this has been raised a million times before and i was just to lazy to use search and hence rather to be removed in a second but it was me a pleasure to give it a try and maybe i am lucky for once to the moon edit added signifcantly more rocket emojis to get this to the moon
0,88,2021-02-01 07:46:10,dont glorify these companies like gamestop and amc dont think for a minute these companies care about you or that they are grand old companies while yes it is good to make money on their stock any idea that these are great companies should be thrown out the executives at these companies are making money hand over fist and they will issue new stock which will drop the stock price some are even are selling their own personal stock beforehand like the guys at gme outside of their prescheduled selling and dont forget that these companies were pieces of shit in the first place they mistreat their employees or buy back games for cents on the dollar gamestop is a hive of scum these people prioritize profit so stop trying to put them in a good light
37,45,2021-02-01 07:45:09,how to fix the short market ive been thinking a bit about how to fix the current short market problems here are my ideas beyond just more transparency 1 when a share is shorted the original holder is explicitly given a synthetic share gmesx or something this solves one aspect of transparency 2 the owners of synthetic shares are entitled to at least half of the charged interest i do think the brokerages should retain their lending fees since it takes overhead to support a short market 3 a synthetic share cannot be traded this is the inherent risk in owning a synthetic stock vs actual you cant move it you can recall your stock at any time but like in the case of gme it might take a while before you have a real share to sell 4 a synthetic share is not itself shortable this should solve the overshort issue why bother doing this basically i think that when an impossible position exists like with gme someone is going to get shafted and id bet its the ones with the least amount of leverage i think these simple changes will still allow shorting give retail investors another passive income generator and still leave the possibility for short squeezes just not infinite ones
282,144,2021-02-01 07:35:04,which would you rather regret imo there is no way to watch what is happening with gme and others and not come out without some level of regret and hindsight remorse the decision over whether or not to buy into this hype or how much to buy comes down to one question that you have to answer for yourself would you rather regret losing some amount of money if the stock ends up going down or would you rather regret staying on the sidelines and watching all these other retarded monkeys fill their cages with so many bananas they dont even know what to do with them all i think this is an interesting way to frame it and i had a moment of clarity last night that i would way rather lose a few thousand if this goes to zero than watch this go to 5k and not be part of it as others have said you are paying to be part of history this is a donation to the cause this is insurance against wishing you had some skin in the game 5000 is not a meme apes strong together we fucking like this stock this is not financial advice buy and sell stonks based on your own ideas i am an individual this is not a collective my brain is smoother than velvet

231,273,2021-02-01 06:56:44,high iq tards what are the possible scenarios in gme right now before i start check my comment history i am not a hedgie shill or bot trying to fear monger and manipulate people due to the influx of new people the sub has turned into a mega echochamber and i feel we are missing answers to some key questions that would otherwise be answered by the 2 or 3 people here that actually fuck their own and our wives it was explained over and over again that the shorts havent covered fuck them and the media for trying to say they did and that the price can only go up as long as they havent covered because at some point they have to and that is fine every single retard also has understood that 1000$ is in fact a meme because were not selling under 10000$ got it what nobody has properly explained though is the stability and confidence in the market and its rules there have been posts saying that goldman is lying when they say the market could collapse which i also understand but can please someone explain to me and anyone else that might still have some further cash to dump into gme can they actually change the rules and freeze trading on gme or manipulate it otherwise if they do what implications would that have can they do it legally if they do it illegally like rh can they get away with it and with what would that leave us if what the ikbr guy has said is actually true and there is some potential for clearing houses and brokers to fail what does that mean for our gains i dont care if this squeeze blows up the economy and the market because its not our fault but wall st fault all i care is if the tendieman will make it through the rough sea i mean michael burry got his money too when the market collapsed in 2008 right i am 100 sure that without any fuckery the squeeze has to happen i am also sure that when it happens we all become millionaires but what are possible fuckery strategies they might try and can they actually pull it off thanks my tards and please mods dont delete this it might actually add to the cause

76,110,2021-02-01 06:50:58,just realized i may be screwed out of many tendies broker only allows limit orders up to $9999 what happens if gme goes past that and i put in a market order in the event that gme does trade above $10000 how would i be able to realize the gains i dont have enough shares for one whole lot less than 100 does the rule that market makers have to fill odd lots at best price apply here i dont have a limit order now plan on putting one when it gets closer to my ultimate target price of 40k laugh if you want ive been screwed by shorters in weedstocks that drove prices down over 90 across the industry so i need 9900 gains just to get back to where i was for the unfamiliar all types of nefarious parties in the cannabis space would frequently short a stock and then buy into a raise at a discount to close their position shortly after the biggest cannabis company curaleaf is built through the profits the founders investment fund made off shorting canadian cannabis he actually bragged about his strategy on bnn bloomberg so tldr im already jaded and willing to lose all as already have lost all so will hold until pluto or bust hence 40k target thank you everyone for any insight if not obvious gme eta im not asking about feasibility of a price above 10000 im asking a practical question what happens with a market order can they fill it with a random bid below the current bidask i only have a few shares and hoping that using a market order at what i consider to be good time wont screw me over somehow thanks eta 2 im not expecting the price to stay at an elevated level for any length of time depending on trading action i will of course adjust my lofty targets i just wanted to know what happens in a one in a million type situation that will last for maybe minutes maybe half an hour and then crash down just as quickly to all those spreading fud crazier things have happened in this market than a stock trading at absurd valuations for a short period of time in the middle of a trading session i just dont want to be caught not knowing what to do if it happens

54,25,2021-02-01 06:33:41,a demonstration that protect the retail investors arguments are in bad faith broker apps do not care about protecting retail investors from market mechanics that have been known to be exploited actively for many many years already this is not a mistake this is not a bug its a feature just not for you the retail investor you should have emptored your caveat look at this trade screen on most all app the default type of buy order is the market order not something that should automatically be limited but something easily exploited by current big fintech if you send a market order on a stock that has hft short sharks waiting for you they will see your order coming years in advance before your order even makes it to new york city they will have bought every single ask between you and their highly overpriced ask the dumb robot executing your trade will buy at any price without question because he has been configured this way by default by your broker yes it was your job to know all of this and now a shark is eating your dick should have stayed out of the water you intellectually challenged retail investor this is how they protect the retail investor see its just a simple plausible oversight at worst and each investor will get bit only once just a little nibble just in the same way we buy our little 4 shares of gme just once no biggie protect the investors yes if they wanted to protect the investors the minimum they would have done is make the default a limit order of 110 of the current stock price or something more sophisticated but the they didnt and they cannot plead ignorance for something out in the open for years something they have netflix documentaries about a bone thrown to the buyer beware crowd why should i beware of my broker isnt that the point of a fiduciary extended discussion the supposed ideal market is a lie it pretends equality of opportunity in the mechanics of the games however no such thing exists traders nearer to the exchange have latency privilege and can leverage this for a permanent edge over all other players journalists and politicians understand this distinction latency is the big deal not the many trades per millisecond ones if all participants had functionally the same latency there would be no problem well there probably would be other problems until the latency privilege is not functionally eliminated there is no equality of opportunity in the market the market is not a leveled playing field duh it will probably never be and to claim otherwise is ideology bordering on misinformation tldr send the latency supremacists to the gulags is what im saying stop gme buys was not about protecting retail investors because they did not care to do that beforehand as shown in the very code of the brokers app the stock market is a retail meat grinder which is fitting since it was designed from the beginning to leech fat off from workers so why not double dip and eat their savings too 
185,101,2021-02-01 06:26:31,how to bypass gamestop buy restrictions exercise calls  mods pleaspleas this has been posted before but i think its very important to know maybe even should be pinned we dont know ifwhich brokerages will be instituting buyorder restrictions on gme etc this week if anyone who is interested and can afford to still wants to buy shares know that it is still possible to exercise your call options by exercising they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought how does it work eli5 each call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price youd want to purchase deep itm calls with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract on robinhood this is manifested as the to break even where this number would ideally be 0 for immediate exercise on other brokerages such as tos displayed in the link as well you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs how do i know if exercising is worth it immediately exercising a call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright right but since immediate exercise isnt how options are usually used there will be some extra costs involved math if $gme is at $300 it would cost $30000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each 100 shares $30000 if we do this via a theoretical option lets say gme is at $300 still and lets say the $45 strike call for feb5 costs $285 each youll pay that $285 to buy the contract now if you want to exercise that contract you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares youre exercising the right to buy in this example 45285100 33000 100 shares $33000 strike price contract cost x 100 the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options obviously this isnt ideal but if robbinghood et al continue their restrictions this will likely be how i will purchase shares of a stock i like i would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw but who cares about paying extra if were going to the moon anyway how do i exercise an option on robbinghood on rh theres a handy little exercise button when you click on your call youd just click through the screens to do it im sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was quick and dirty but i have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again if you have questions i will try to answer in the comments and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free not financial advice dumbass ps get fucked cnbc pps mods pls post edit fucking forgot im so sorry

345,211,2021-02-01 06:15:04,endgame dd game over theory  disclaimer i own 23 shares of gme at 273 and im bull this is not investment advice are you wondering when how if this will all be over youve come to the right post this endgame dd is about no stock in particular and shouldnt be taken as investment advice so your answer if you havent seen this post please check it out i think it does an ok job at theorizing the point at which a large short has to cover and how we get there user does a great job explaining that there will be massive volatility if we are to go forward theres also a good theory of a presqueeze price and postsqueeze price where all holders make value $ no squeeze has happened yet only a small exit of short positions leveraged back into more shorts things the user forgot to mention as a strategy for someone bullish other than buy and hold other methods can be used to drive up prices remove your shares from the available short position do it now then tell a friend google says phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place your shares for sale at for arguments sake double todays price as they are on order they cannot be lent out by your broker and in turn you are reducing the amount of free shares out there that can be used for shorting purposes shorts increased their position if you have any stock you want to increase in value set a sell limit order for what you think is fair value another thing brokers are limiting buying accelerates the process way faster 21 years is the estimate when they will be bust at current $300 value i think it was an overestimate that can be much faster with buys buys with the conviction that the leadership from is now solid buys where you trust others to see the company and its stock growing buys because you like the stock anyone can buy from almost anywhere asia eu canada us find out if you can purchase too taking away available shares to short and buying could reduce the estimate to an untenable short term position period the last thing not mentioned is a margin call oh did you invest on margin and overleverage your position on gme like these hedge funds prepare for an unexpected call when the clearing firm calls in and asks you to meet minimum deposit requirements or sells your position however this only happens if bulls are quick and consistent volatility needs to be so insane and price so high that shorts need to clear out and cut losses so quickly that they never have the capacity to short again the reason robinhood said fuck you 1 share a piece was that their dtcc depositcash on hand requirements went way up no speculation just a fact they unlike other brokers have 56 of 13 million known users who have a stake in heavily shorted gamer stock in theory if 30 more users bought 1 share of a $312 stock that would add $1216800000 of value hedges lose long before that but 56 is rookie numbers we can get that to 99 now read this in theory just by buying and holding you could force robinhood and other brokers to call in their investment from leveraged shorts ding ding ding three shitron lemons just flashed in a row and paid out however investing isnt for everyone huge volatility for your one allowance of share can be involved if you buy high and sell low that is as much of a loss as someone who shorted a position that was sound long term my investment advice has always been only put in what you can lose never 140 buy a ticket to the show they could sell out quickly dvf bought 55000 tickets at such a low price but low is relative to what is the current high personally i think $300 for your ticket to the show is a good deal for the hedgies loss porn but you have to hold it to enter tldr if you have rocket fuel we will be going to the moon 
55,118,2021-02-01 05:57:11,dd broader markets wont crash buy spy calls vix puts and hold gme tldr last weeks broder market selloff was likely spurred by fear that the we were going to crash the whole system by diamond handing gme and its ilk the overall effect of the demise of these few short sellers wont be large enough to crash the whole system over the next one to two weeks spy likely to come back vix likely to go down keep holding gme if you like the stock more details in the full text of the below bloomberg article for the few of you whose attention span exceeds 10 seconds i bolded the important parts gamestop short nightmare shows few signs of becoming a contagion gamestop corps surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent but those bearish positions probably arent big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds thats the view of barclays plc strategists led by maneesh deshpande by plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole markets capitalization they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008 moreover those mostheavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0001 of the $43 trillion market whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a fullblown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last weeks selling the worst in the sp 500 since october for now while redditfueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative theyre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market were witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity but on the other hand we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that dont have an outsize influence said marshall front chief investment officer at front barnett associates the underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong a very aggressive and accommodative policy by the federal reserve is still intact together they help the stock market on the way up burned by short sales going against them hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record the mostshorted stocks rallied 14 last week as a group dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last april a goldman sachs group inc basket shows while the sp 500 dropped more than 3 last week traders described the broad market as orderly to jpmorgan chase cos strategists including dubravko lakosbujas the retreat is likely a shortlived technical tumble with earnings improving and us consumers strengthening this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks particularly those geared toward an economic recovery the strategists wrote in a friday note to be sure day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors trying to spur squeezes in 2021 the top quintile of the russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20 compared with a loss of 08 for the bottom 600 according to data compiled by bloomberg but those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased gains in companies with shakier finances which had trailed during 2020s pandemic market although the short squeeze started with gme it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks deshpande at barclays wrote in a note friday referring to gamestops ticker while we expect some more deleveraging ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited by barclayss tally short sales totaled $800 billion or roughly 2 of the total market value of american equities a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves the heavily shorted companies those with interest making up more than 20 of their share float saw $40 billion of their stock sold short or 5 of the total pool of bearish bets we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized deshpande said the bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term the risk of a fullfledged contagion remains low
529,157,2021-02-01 05:43:13,reminder on gme why we like the stock gme this has escalated faster than my dick when dfv posts while pretty much everyone who bought into gme sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this lets take a step back and review the facts amidst the bot attacks fake news and overall noise coming from the powers at be 1 gamestops long term prospects look good marketing $$$ and more $$$ fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model thankfully it has we can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out he involved himself on the board brought in his former chewy associates and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form obviously when board members and csuits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company if you go and read wikipedia on gme you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in if the people running the company do not care about the value of it they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed so yay management now gives a fuck we have our first ingredient aligned $$$ now on to the second ingredient big $$$ gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again which with shit management is to be expected with the new interest from stakeholders gme took off gaining market cap and opening up a new avenue of financing even if gme hit a modest market cap of lets say 65bb they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much but now with a market cap approaching 20bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash which in turn means they can pay off their debt increase their credit rating and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again third ingredient attention and faith self explanatory the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing now literally everyone and their mother will know about gme forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for massive tendies x200b now when we combine aligned monetary interests with new financing capability huge investor confidence on management and brand awareness well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam with these few ingredients gme can cook up so many tendies we already know they are working on making pc gaming more mainstream and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams think the nintendo center in nyc for the heads who know gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together or maybe hangout and have a beer adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and i expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop maybe not exactly like a video game bar but some form of live socialgaming experience is something that i think is highly likely they will integrate 2 the financial institutions have their back against the wall nothing can save them other than a gov bailout its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down there is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece i do not think they will become insolvent because you know wall street but there is no way they do not take heavy losses the sheer grit from new comers lurkers big names and ogs is unspeakable people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say bears r fukt hedgies eat cock which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming they have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things they know how much money they control how to influence the right people and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want well jokes on them cuz my wifes boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain and guess what so can everyone else in this game now people are just buying buying and then buying some more no matter the financial hurt the buy side pressure has not and will not degrademaybe when we hit 500 a share since a lot of people might get priced out then but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market so they are in a pretty pickle the longer they wait us out the fewer shares they have to work with the higher the price the more they bleed the more they short the worse it gets basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are so hold because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell become distracted create fud prevent us from buying restrict options you name it x200b all we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys the challenge the real challenge that gives us our diamond hands is waiting yes patience as buffet has once said the stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient we are the patient we are strong together we are the fucking players and the hedgies know it they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money and each day they have to work to remain afloat every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy gme when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital x200b tldr gamestop has all the ingredients to generate real long term value for their shareholders be patient the shorts have already lost its a matter of how much now be patient the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves while we just has to scroll wsb and find confirmation bias dd like this one pretty simple be patient watch shorts cry make unlimited tendies do not let anyone influence your decision on whether to buy or sell gme make your own decisions and stand by them i am not a professional these are my opinions not financial advice x200b 420 share 1369 gamestonk
267,58,2021-02-01 05:40:02,i was a corpo but now i see wsb was right all along in ye old days when dinosaurs only dreamed of moonyachts budding traders slung $uvxy and tendies were of $nugt not calls i opened a brokerage account with an imposing $200 after some adventures with ol yeller i was up some 30 that could finance an entire charcuterie instead of ramen it was a blast and i was ready to yolo my cheese and my crackers into the sky enter $nvax with late stage trials that would dominate a deadly baby flu you see i had a whole $260 an a in an undergrad portfolio class and knew nothing about vaccines it literally could not go tits up a few days later as biotech do my cheese was cut and a thing of dreams after my cheese portfolio tanked i though maybe the smart money was on to something my yolo didnt take me to the moon but mooned me instead naturally i joined the dark side closed my position went to grad school helped write textbooks taught analysts and went full corpro but see working for the man is not the same as being the man it took my time it stressed me away from my high school sweetheart and it wasnt going to pay enough for studying full time again mid pandemic i said fuck it to my own fundamentals and yolod on myself by quitting though i cant have my time girlfriend or education money anyway now i dont regret it for a minute i know that this is the way because you tendie trackers and the markets confirmed it you took gme to the moon penetrating billionaire portfolios ol yeller is back now queen of the treasury and most poetically of all $nvax went to the moon just last friday even though i didnt get to ride these rockets i did learn a lesson dont let your memes settle as dreams you were right all along wsb not financial advice
17475,1290,2021-02-01 04:56:24,the big long explained since wsb grew millions overnight i see a lot of questions regarding gme ill try to answer those here 1 whats happening with gme the gme play is a very simple problem of supply and demand without having to explain what shorting is just know that as long as short interest is over 100 the following applies there are 100 sellers of gme there are 200 buyers of gme we retailshareholders represent 100 of the buyers above the other 100 buyers represent hedge funds the difference being that we already bought hedge funds are still on the hook now because of this hedge funds want to buy for as low a price as possible and every day that they dont they are paying billions in interest this tips the tables in our favour since we dont have to pay any interest for not selling in a nutshell if we dont sell the price of gme can theoriticaly go to infinity 2 how can you participate all you need to do is buy $gme with your cash on thursday we saw what happens if you buy shares with the enemys money margin they short attack to push the price lower and sell your shares via a margin call if you have a reputable broker you can also disable lending of your shares to further limit the supply 3 what stage are we in if youve seen the big short we are in the stage where everyone realises the system is corrupt and the banks are scrambling to find a way to profit and not go bankrupt in this movie you are the ones betting that the housing market will go down and the hedge funds are the banks the brokers which disallowed buying of gme are the rating agencies 4 is it safe to make this bet in a noncorrupt free market buying gme while short interest is over 100 is a free money glitch youre basically betting against corruption at this point in time history has shown corruption is rampant so do not bet more than youre willing to lose think of it as a donation against corruption that might get you a lot of money if you win 5 is this what wallstreetbets is about no wsb is about taking risks and treating the market as a casino via the purchasing of derivatives option contracts in speculative plays this is the first time in wsb history that buying shares is being advocated 6 is this financial advice no i just really like the stock disclaimer 
10708,487,2021-02-01 04:51:15,were not the bad guys bad guys are the ones who would crash the market rather than taking the loss their plan heres what they might do this week notice how goldman sachs are saying that gme might crash the market they are going to do it and scare us into selling gme at the same time blaming us for the crash to get public support for more government regulations against us im a pretty smart ape and thats what i would do notice how gme has been going against spy lately it might reverse to tank all together this week when they sell their long positions and short gme at the same time but have no fear fellow apes just hold onto that bananananana and gme will eventually come back up in shorting even more they are incurring a much higher interest day after day i would just ignore the market this week and do something fun to relax until you hear about the squeeze has squoeze
102,184,2021-02-01 04:50:00,possible gme capital raise scenarios i think rightswarrants distribution most likely tldr gamestop the company has not done anything since the stock surged theyve said nothing the boards objective is to make this a longterm win it is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts burning the shorts is fun for them but not their job a significant cash infusion via capital raise around $1 billion or so would increase their positive outcomes a lot there are a few ways to do this but i think the best is a rights dividendwarrant offering where current shareholders get warrants this would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable shortterm volatility but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot disclaimer not financialinvestingtax advice im not a sellside expert and dont have investment banking experience but if any sellside experts give me commentary on this thread ill integrate and credit i probably got some details wrong im shortterm bullish on this stock but have a tiny longterm put position gamestop as a business would longterm benefit from more cash right now they have 949m of longterm debt and a bunch of leases theyd like to cancel and severance payments theyd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores they also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses such as ecommerce any new ideas and the rest extinguishing this debt completely ditching bad stores and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent even if they turn around and issue new debt at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved to do this they need to raise capital while they could use debt i dont think that makes sense with equity at these values therefore they will try equity if they do the three approaches that make some sense also the three most frequent approaches are to do a secondary offering similar to an ipo which is a primary offering do an offtheshelf offering which they technically can already do $100m of or do a rights distribution additionally gme will want to regain control of their stock tilrays founder commented on this recently but basically when the stock is like this there are a lot of side effects more legal risks any options or rsus you issue employees stop being longterm motivating a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals its not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile here is some more detail of my nonprofessional understanding of these fundraising methods i think a rights distribution is most likely secondary listing this would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out just like an ipo the problem is that to do this they have to offer at a discount this will enrage current shareholders this also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately which also will enrage the current shareholders i think this one is bad press all around and i think theyd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility they also open themselves up to lawsuits because the price is very volatile and if gme is for example at $100 3 weeks from now its an instant lawsuit by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large i think this is their worst option off the shelf listing gme already has a $100m authorization for this i suspect but dont know they already used it i believe there are some timing issues here but this is the second best option i think there are some timing delays on being able to use it and there may still be some legal risks im unaware of optically i think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline public rights distribution a writeup on this in general here i think this is their best option in this they would dividend out warrants to shareholders this is an option except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share instead of someone having to sell you an existing share so it dilutes usually this is done as 1 warrant per x shares so for example they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held they could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price but obviously not lawsuit bait such as $20 dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now and raise them $1000000000 roughly in cash because these only go to existing shareholders it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in does not punish longs realistically though theyll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences the way this would play out is that theyd first announce the rights distribution probably a few days to a week before this will result in some interesting market dynamics that ill describe in a moment then youd get the rights distribution as a gme long as a gme short youd have to serve up the rights distribution to the long you borrowed shares from because there are a lot more longs than shares this would have some chaos which the market makers would have to sort out then there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant which youd be able to do through your broker theyll want this as short as possible so that the price doesnt fall below the warrant price then they clear all the warrants and a day or two later deliver all the shares to people this is their best approach i think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place i dont know how the laws would work on insiders i think they can exercise these but im sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it they probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean rights market dynamics i find this very hard to predict but this would have a few effects 1 upon the warrantsrights being granted not declared stock will fall in price significantly but longs shouldnt actually lose money because they also were granted warrants in theory warrant value stock value for a given number of shares plus their granted warrants should be the same as the prior stock price in other words i dont really see it as bearish or bullish 2 you would not want to be long call options through this very itm calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively but otm longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced if you do have an itm call you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares or selling it if you sell and are still bullish you can then go and buy shares would not recommend trying to buy otm calls after this repricing though i guess you could 3 puts are the reverse puts that are shorter dated than the distribution dont change puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didnt change 4 you could be short through this but its a little annoying most likely youll be marked short the warrant so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure but this has to be closed out before the exercise date so warrants will all get called in at some point in a sense its forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted stocks originally held same value as the stock alone was before theyd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from likely a bit of a mess would cause some short covering alongside that call selling would this be more buying or selling i dont know the stock is super levered i dont think it would matter a lot initially though 5 after the distribution happens the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed original stock same market cap but stock price down this will be more the case after shares delivered the reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock calls on one side short on the other it also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place 6 gme would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turnaround the only downside of this is its a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people but i think its the most fair to existing shareholders causes the least legal risk and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turnaround what im uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution they may want to distribute more modestly than im suggesting for this reason other unknowns i dont know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required it seems to me its close to a stock split so maybe none any investment bankers have thoughts on this minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders maximum dilution in situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price this obviously would not work at all my sense is they can be at a discount and can dilute but may have maximums anyone able to confirm who is an expert timing my understanding which may be incorrect is they cant do this before earnings their fiscal year i think ends this week so theyd have to hurry to do this would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming

41,47,2021-02-01 03:36:49,fractional shares another robinhood shitvention in addition to operating on billion dollar transactions with razor thin fault margins question if every buys 1 share of a hypothetical company lets say $gme the brokerages have different techniques to actually buy it they could hold it for you put it directly in your account take your order and give you an iou all kinds but its still 1 share and you the guy with smol leverage are essentially the one holding it but if everyone had 20 bucks left over why wouldnt you use it on fractional shares of $gme they are fractional to you but to the brokerages they probably have to hold the fullwhole share to divide amongst the public they are absolutely just held by the brokerage or some subholding company so effectively you are forcing the brokerage to also hold gme as it would be difficult for them to offload the shares if they are shares by 30 different monkeys
185,241,2021-02-01 03:03:03,what happens if big institutions cant payrebuy dear my regards i have a noob question about the markets and our situation with gme imagine all of us regards wont sell our stonks below 69420$ something very high small melvin will not be able to put up this huge amount of cash not even if the lender liquidates all their assets what happens in that case what happens if the price increases further and further and shorts arent able to close their position at some point somewhere some rules are going to get broken right because this is a situation that should not happen and somehow can not happen so what is going to happen to retail will the lender make some kind of deal with melvin usually if you cant pay your debt you will default into bankruptcy and what is going to happen when shorts go bankrupt who is going to buy back the shorted positions i assume its no one rules will be broken and the small retail trader without any lobby will pay the mess to be honest i dont have much knowledge about the finance industry so this was going around my head maybe someone with greater knowledge could tell me what is going to happen next please dont get me wrong and downvote me i am trying to understand the chances and risks of this play and also the greater picture because usually the big capital wins and not the retail pleb as you can already see rules are changed mid game because it simply cant happen that the big ones fail and retail wins it is not intended to work like this the system so maybe i am completely missing something can you discuss with me and help me understand have a nice evening my regards and lets fckng hold the next week let them bleed

10,54,2021-02-02 02:26:53,i think that the silver hate is actually what they are looking for here me out before you nuke me preface buy gme dont sell hold and fuck citadel i am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks the criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct there are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up i hope you all realize that the hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of gme they understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it paper silver shares are not the move obviously but silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly emphasis on next do not sell gme or move into this position until this war is over if people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares it will result in devastation for the hedgies and big banks this is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get wsbs to call off the dogs on silver all together dont underestimate your enemy they understand what reactions their actions will get silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble but it needs to be done in a specific way if the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material if the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens they are fucked this is still the long play imo but i have been in this space for many many years it is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes it could be the best next move in this war but we will see i am long silver but i am a physical collector i think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after my suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now but dont forget about it when the gme stage finally resolves that is what they want lets win this gme short squeeze before we promote any other moves but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies they are learning what their actions result in and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they dont want you focusing on i truly believe this is a fake out and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the pm space thats just my opinion though do as you see fit gme to pluto gg no re

208,30,2021-02-02 02:02:19,more trickery gme attack explained repost from friday now that its relevant usnickysnacks the predictor buy the fucking dip theyre punishing the retards that held calls to expiry without also holding enough money for the shares tldr not investment advice market goes up and down i think gme will go up but this is to protect the true retards that held fds through to expiry on a low budget account they could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of itm calls on monday you can short the float for 100 shares essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself then you get rid of them both on open with full gains price is down $20 ah so be prepared for the morning dip more scare tactics so if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering in most cases they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money in this case the target would be $320 but my theory is since there is a huge short interest its better for the big players to let gme finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest 300 320 to all get autoexercised most retail traders dont know how to prevent the autoexercise so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 and various other strikes under the 325 closing price then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in afterhours market which has much less exposure to the retail investors right now the price is down to 300 this allows them to gain a profit of $20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more if the price continues to drop if the price actually tanks well below 300 this will additionally trigger margin calls monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers its too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a selloff but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls to give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price hf buys gme when it dipped under $150 hf sells gme 320 calls after it goes back up for $$$$ market pins gme at 325 at expiry forcing auto assignment of 320s instead of allowing the cheap gme to be called away they force the price down after hours they buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount since they will get $320 for them price was bouncing pretty hard between 300320 but creeping back over 320 now should be quite interesting to see if it holds usnickysnacks get in here so they dont think i wrote this im long gme this is opinion only and not investment im also not responsible for any temporarily capped gains because you dont understand the words delta neutral
37,48,2021-02-02 02:01:53,thanks for the ride gme gang i havent had this much fun since mstx i bought gme as a value play last year i bought more after the earnings crash and got really excited when cohen came on the board i figured that i was all set that my $18 avg cost shares would soon be worth $50 or even $60 wow what a return then i heard about the squeeze thesis i figured it was wsb nonsense but buyers are buyers i wrote this and you degenerates seemed to love it i didnt know how close to right i would be its been a wild ride but today i took 90 of my profits off the table i sold a good chunk of my shares last week to regain my initial investment you should always risk manage and let the rest ride i still have ten shares and really hope that they go to $1000 or more im taking a safer long position by selling $40p weeklies ill be buying in postsqueeze regardless of what happens but in the meantime ill be using my gains to pay off student loans and live a debtfree life why did i do this when i see crowds ignoring information just because they dont like it i get scared s3 came out with some numbers over the weekend that indicate a lot of shorts have covered is that solid i dont know but its enough to tell me i should be cautious nearly 60k out of the sky is something id be stupid to let slip away if you have money you need in gme please take it back let your winnings ride but dont risk your mortgage buffett says to be fearful when others are exuberant and exuberant when others are fearful gme gang is just too exuberant for me plays like gme come once or twice in a lifetime and i just dont feel comfortable risking for me lifechanging money on a chance that itll become slightly more lifechanging i wish you well i look forward to seeing the gain porn if im missing out on something huge please be careful please stick around if you intend to be a positive part of wsb postgme please fuck off if you dont i hope the squeezening happens and makes you all rich now go learn what an fd is edit apparently this is one of the most controversial posts on reddit in the last hour i didnt even know they did that kind of analytics if youre downvoting someone whos telling you they just changed their life because theyre not risking their future on the same thing as you ask yourself why that makes you angry im still long gme i think that ryan cohen is going to do incredible things to the company and im still risking my money on that belief so why are you mad

5191,382,2021-02-02 01:36:33,dont panic and just look at the fucking volume if you are panicking go to your shitty robinhood app and change it from a line chart to a candle chart the top will show you a volume the total since 930 is less than 2 million think logically if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million there is 79 million retards in here if we all panicked the volume would go through the roof this is another attack by hedge funds to force a selloff and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling buy the fucking dip we can remain retarded longer than they remain solvent edit i believe robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and i should have thought to check a better platform before making this post however there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount to put into perspective the last attack which was on thursday x200b notice the huge red dildo staring at your face now look at the bar under that dildo that is the volume is that move remotely justified by that little volume look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on volume was 4x on those days compared to thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare to make this more understandable look at the retard on your left and then look at the retard on your right fyi theyre not fucking selling note this is not financial advice and i dont know what i even wrote up lol i just really like gme lol

224,84,2021-02-01 22:03:45,possible real reason brokers are restricting buys on gme we wsb have many roles in this gme saga one of them is the detective it is up to us to figure out the crime and the weak point of the criminals behind the counterfeit stocks here is a brief history of the crime 1 some hedge funds naked short gme and disguise as normal shorts in the system this pushes short interest to 140 this everybody agrees on 2 dfv see this and starts a manic squeeze 3 massive shares bought by wsb and no doubt other funds 4 as prices rose these buy trades start to fail ie the seller fails to deliver the shares to the buyer after 2 days in settlement you can see the volume on sec fails website some guy tallied up to 15m shares failed when price was 10 in december you can use your imagination what is the fail count at price 350 note above 10000 fails gets the stock on sec watch list 5 because these shares failed to deliver rh and all brokers faced a sudden margin call from clearing why simple rh clients bought shares that are simply not turning up so rh is essentially short gme stock to its customers hence has to post 100 margin instead of 2 and likely the normal interbank loan channels are closed for this high risk purpose 6 what can brokers do they can enforce a buyin that means they can force the seller to buy the missing stocks in market using funds in the shorts account the us buyin rules are pretty complex but i understand that it is up to the buyer to enforce a buyin ie rh has to initiate the buyin 7 what happens at buyin they bid for the volume at any price the naked shorter goes bankrupt expending all their fund networth to buy stonks that dont exist from people who dont like them so key question is this when will rh and all brokers enforce the buyin and why are they not doing it right now
2315,194,2021-02-01 18:07:08,make sure you look after yourself this week comrades the next few days will likely be a wild ride its very easy to spend all day reading our retarded posts on wsb and watching the minute by minute price action just please make sure for your own sanity to take some time away from your phone go for a walk have a wank lick your wifes boyfriends toes i dont really give a fuck just do something other than incessantly watching the price its not healthy positions a measly 20 shares of gme 
1471,73,2021-02-01 17:32:49,a message from a fallen soldier hello guys i just wanted to say how blown away i am by whats happening last year i was heavily invested most of my portfolio not smart i know in gnus which ended up getting fucked by and overshorted by citron resulting in heavy losses i was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital i was forced to pull back from trading because i couldnt sustain the loss im 22 with a tax bill and a business thats on hold due to covid so i can only take so many losses another year another opportunity for a bounceback hopefully i genuinely believed in the company and went long but then citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad pr and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down i remember seeing teachers firemen and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason they tried to do the same with gamestop but you guys didnt let it happen this genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes im playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation explaining whats going on where to buy gme and why these institutions deserve the punishment theyre getting its working excited to be back in the game once i hopefully get the business up and running after covid keep strong ladies and gents 3
108,16,2021-02-02 17:30:20,gme evidence of short seller collusion for months and an explanation for why short estimates are probably way off mods this is important please dont remove so far many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with gme recently what if i tell you that short interest is going down is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks let me explain today i saw something very strange on webull i saw shares of gme being traded in l2 data for $14 20$ and around $30 i managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong i made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again the order obviously didnt get filled x200b processing img lmjh2m5bn0f61 at first i thought this might be a glitch but after thinking about it more it clicked ive been following gme for months the key is within why these prices were chosen $14 $20 $30 folks whove been following gme closely know that gme broke $14 for the first time after the microsoft deal both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for gmes price so why are we seeing these prices again today i have a theory short sellers were having ladder attacks back then but the way they probably did them was the following lets say hedgefund a and hedgefund b are colluding to bring the price down since there are no shares available to borrow a buys 1000 shares and lends them to b b then shorts those shares but makes sure that a is the one buying them a lends these shares to b again and b shorts them again this continues until the price gets down to the desired level this artificially increases the short interest of gme but in reality only 1000 shares have been changing hands if you look carefully you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices here is the thing these shortsellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created the fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest in theory seems to be going down also proves this im baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks they are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point now you might ask what if all of the short interest is artificial the answer is an obvious no why do you ask because if they didnt have massive short positions they wouldnt have to do these ladder attacks to begin with how do i know or rather guess that the actual short interest hasnt gone down by a lot 2 reasons 1 the stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages afaik 2 the following screenshot shows that there are only 159 of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than todays closing price which would be around 1109m shares position cost distribution as you know todays closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and friday which means one thing there are at most 1109m shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands so the short interest at most has gone down by 01596975m 1109m in the past two days unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them which seems unlikely to me since i havent seen any sec filings from institutions what i do not know is this do these shortsellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of short selling or not my guess is that they dont because 1 they are probably scared of getting caught 2 another reason why i think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for gme has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case when they are using these type of ladder attack the estimates are probably higher than reality and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower 3 i think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks also note that shorts dont have to borrow and sell to each other to create a ladder they can just buy and sell from each other however i think theyve done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates based on this evidence i believe that the squeeze has not squoze this also suggests that shortsellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal disclaimer im not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice this is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise ive been long gme and have a lot of gme shares hopefully sec will take a close look at what these shortsellers are doing but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while i doubt that anyone will do anything about this
130,36,2021-02-02 17:12:10,some motivation to hold gme im holding because i truly believe in the wealth gap in the usa while teachers can struggle to make ends meet billionaires can go play golf on their lunch break and not worry about a dime i really want to see this wealth transfer to the working class to see what they would do with it personally i would start up my own business and i would hope many people would also take that opportunity just last week when the gains were going crazy us redditors were going into our local communites and spreading the joy of giving i believe that the more money the working class has access to the better the economy soon walmart wont be owned by majority stakeholders and billionaires no it will be the common people thats just a far fetched ideaexample but i hope you guys can understand what im trying to get at eli5 imagine a world where cooperations arent owned by big banks but rather the common folk this is how we start the movement by holding gme to expose wall street and allow everyday retail investors the equal opportunity edit i just like the idea of hyvee and their employee owned business idea not owned entirely by the big man but rather employees edit 2 i know this could all sound completely retarted but thats what free speech is all about to bounce ideas off each other and build deeper thoughts
223,56,2021-02-02 17:02:01,madman theory and $gme the biggest game of financial chicken in history machiavelli once wrote that sometimes it is a very wise thing to simulate madness with recent revelations of possible if not likely share counterfeiting continued aggressive short ladder attacks and increasing media distractionsdisinfo i have a theory i want wsbs input on short sellers are not just cheating at the game theyre scaring the referees into submission what we know 1 volume was incredibly low today thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors and good monkes holding 2 despite low volume we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down 3 even with conservativefavorable estimates on short interest hfsmmsbrokerages are still extremely exposed because 4 there is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out except continuously kicking the can down the road as beautifully put by uforzan their cure is a poison they cant stop taking this all points to textbook brinkmanship or a form of madman theory gme shorts have taken the financial system hostage strapped it into the back seat and are driving fullspeedahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken from what weve seen hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet to the point that it threatens to crash the market they know they lost the match so their only option is to work the referees my guess is that theyre trying to fill the powder keg even more and make the potential fallout so destructive the sec has no choice to step in and halt trading whatever fines or punishments are levied cant possibly be as bad as the alternative which is an extinction event for multiple firms hfs and brokerages so how can the little respond youve got to convince them youre more irrational than they are this shouldnt be difficult for this group of shitthrowing apes from the wikipedia article on brinkmanship for brinkmanship to be effective the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions however a threat is ineffective unless credibleat some point an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action the hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the credibility of their threat as early as wednesday last week theyre trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs dont cancel the match to win retail investors have to show theyre completely prepared to hold to $0 tldr monke crazier than you are
72,19,2021-02-02 16:59:46,the us economy is a human body and wsb is acting as the white blood cells  wsb is sticking it to the billionaire shortsellers and making them pay for crushing companies into the dirt the implications of this will be far reaching and in the longrun overwhelmingly positive if you think about predatory shortselling and its effects on the economy it is a practice that removes value from the our economic system imagine all the new companies that if given a legitimate chance to grow may have produced huge value for the entire economy imagine if melvin capital had been successful with tesla in that regard the effects of putting off the ev revolution and our general move away from fossil fuels could have been disastrous not to mention the fact that the cybertruck is gonna be cool as fuck and the world would be a bit sadder without it the damage they have done already is incalculable enter wsb our system has produced a new type of cell the wsb autist after having surviving the 2008 financial crisis we have evolved with a personal risk tolerance of 100 and an imbred hate for hedgefunds we were just waiting for our time enter dfv his grand autism showed us the path to avenging our parents enriching ourselves and fixing our broken financial systems all at once shortselling will never be carried out the same way ever again the game is over and we ended it we will in one fell swoop clear the path to innovation in the future and pull down billions from the top of the economy to the bottom position all cash except my 5 allotted gme cuz fuck robinhood
649,116,2021-02-02 16:00:27,please read this you apes this will be longer than we thought read these links if you arent lazy i suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions tldr melvin and gang hasnt covered shit theyve been illegally closing out their short positions and if we hold they will 100 get fucked there is far more nefarious shit at play so this morning i saw the s3 and ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for gme this absolutely threw me for a loop because friday morning they reported above 120 short interest still i could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close 50 of short positions on such a tightly held stock in one day with very little trading volume in the week this got me digging around to figure out whats up i started by looking into gme failed to delivers ie short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of january and i was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of jan gme had 12 million failed to delivers this is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying what was interesting though is that of that 12million 700k shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period i dug further back into the sec failed to deliver reports for gme and saw that pattern extending back months it seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road having spent some time looking at the pattern its clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in then a small chunk of coverage then another large amount and so on to me this looked shady af so i looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article in it a specific section is eerily similar to what weve experienced with gme assuming that xyz eg gme is a hard to borrow security eg apes holding strong and that trader a melvin or its brokerdealer is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at trader as clearing firm rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market trader a might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the brokerdealers closeout requirement but in reality allows trader a to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale most often this is done through the use of a buywrite trade but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term flex options these trades are commonly referred to as reset transactions in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the brokerdealer must purchase or borrow the stock to closeout a fail the transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations such transactions were alleged by the commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firms responsibility to close out a failure to deliver its almost like a play by play of what weve seen in combination with the ladder attacks my guess is well find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of jan comes out on the 17th i 100 think that melvin is committing massive securities fraud in fact i would bet all my money on it oh wait i did 96 gme 290 i am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail more dd not a financial adviser i eat paint chips for dinner one paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link credit to ubcripster i dont mean the bet wsb played that marvin had 140 of the float i mean that vanguard fidelity and blackrock have sold more than the total shares that exist thats a completely different problem and its punishable by jail time not a joke its basically counterfeiting stock shares although thats not the terminology used if this is true who knows how many other times theyve done this or maybe its not true and they just really like the stock if blackrock started buying five days ago and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days then the doomsday clock doesnt run out until at least february 17th if wall street can get wsb to sell before then then they wont get caught and wont go to jail but if they dont well this will make enron look like chump change if enough people hold until the end of february and this is truly the situation then there is a chance that major parts of wall street are going to implode the conclusion apes need diamond hands until the end of february in order to get the sec involved most likely somewhere between feb 17th 19th whether or not this will happen is anybodys guess but if it does all heck may break loose my opinion this along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring march 19th that were just bought see the front page of wsb means that this may not end for a few weeks maybe even longer the only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are held are we going to do this or are we going to paper hand out if were commuting to this shit lets do it if youre gonna paper hand eventually we dont want you get out it just makes it worse the later you paper hand someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are tldr if these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes you may have to hold up until end of february or even longer but this shit is happening also dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out this is really important take a walk workout read watch tv spend some time with family take some breaks from staring at the ticker it may not do much other than be manipulated lower rise slightly and be stable in the near term but this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled i own gme like the stock and this is not financial advice its merely a suggestion and trying to help people learn more nothing more you can do as you choose
751,123,2021-02-02 15:52:29,who do you think can hold out longer youre account losing money or billionaires having to pay more every day due to interest gme will go back up and rocket soon why well lets see here oh yeah the short interest is still above 100 fuck you s3 and youre bullshit numbers the amount of volume trading has gone down from 130 million to 2040m yet the number of buys versus sells is still heavily skewed towards buys meanwhile hedge funds are manipulating the stock by making massive amounts of tiny calls and puts and buys and sells in order to drive the price down and trick algorithms into thinking there are massive sell offs when in reality everyone is buying and holding do not fall for these scare tactics the longer we buy and hold the worse their short interest gets and the more this hurts them please understand it costs you nothing to hold because you havent lost money yet unless you sell dont but hedge funds are losing billions everyday due to the interest on their short puts they borrowed stock at $10share and now those stocks are $200 per share they have to pay the difference who do you think can hold out longer billionaires losing billions everyday or your account going further in the red despite not actually owing any money this is why we hold

47,24,2021-02-02 14:56:35, 1000 shares one by one in quick succession would this hypothetically be a long ladder attack if you cant read tldr at end i want to emphasize upfront this is all hypothetical and in way shape or form am suggesting to do anything in this post put your tin foil hats on for a moment if a group of people were to buy 1 share of a stock at a time in quick succession would this be the exact opposite of a short ladder attack a counter perhaps is a long ladder attack a thing if this is possible wouldnt this just be correcting the market value since it had been so manipulated the hedge funds are playing dirty and it feels like an unfair fight this post is for educational purposes only i like the stock the hedgefund billionaires are working overtime plotting against us and paying the media and whoever has influence to get away everything we need to step it up i believe we need to get the smartest retards among us connected in a group to do some serious dd and bring enough solid proof of these counterfeit shares and manipulation we need to fling at every company that is doing us dirty get us in contact with any journals you guys know and lets get our own wsb articles out lets all spam the sec with the facts from our dd findings on gme and lets be as vocal as possible outside of reddit think about how important the secs credibility is do you think they would risk that to save melvin and some other hedgefunds if the public knows whats going on is illegal and we pressure the sec to regulate the market and do there damn job then how could they not imagine how much people would pull out money from the market if the sec lost there credibility we dont actually need to play dirty to win but we need all be active besides just gme to the moon and lets put hours of work in like wallstreet does and lets get shit done sorry if some of this was rant like i appreciate everything you guys do in this sub i put my life savings in at 335 to show support but if we go down it sure as hell wont be without the hardest fight we could possibly put up tldr lets get more dd also is buying 1 share at a time fast considered a long ladder attack not financial advice i eat deodorant

336,42,2021-02-02 14:34:43,why im holding i dont know enough about the market but i do know enough about marketing and astroturf campaigns holy shit there are lot of them going on this is the piece of information that has really sealed the deal for me this week and can not be explained away innocent people with nothing to lose dont take the time or spend the money to create astroturf and floods of misinformation this is a move for guilty as fuck people with a lot of skin in the game you think the shorts are out if they were they would not give a shit about changing the narrative here is why i think they picked silver 1 it was already going up with gold so they just had to point at it and say look 1 its so fucking big $$$ wise that we cant effect it so they arent giving us any control in their new narrative 1 silver is a total boomer thing so its highly unlikely that any of us would have and shares to sell anyway 1 its pretty victimless because its a commodity if they had said the name of an individual company it would have been much more targeted and would have caused more problems for them if i was on their marketing team i couldnt have picked a better red haring i got into this last week on damn good information before the bullshit started we know that gme was 130 short halfway though january nyse report we know that dfv is still in we know that someone out there with something to lose is throwing a small army of reporters market manipulators at us most of all i know that my worst loses have always come when i have folded out of fear i would rather ride this to the gme fair value of $150 then bitch out now and possibly miss my shot edit per uostnic no we can not trust the data i would say even the nyse report coming out on the 9th if these guys are willing to commit fraud and market manipulation they will lie on a report that is assuming they dont have some tool to fudge the numbers legally i cant tell you enough how easy it is to change a statistic to fit a narrative dont believe anything is a fact unless you can personally verify it with your own eyes these campaigns are engineered to hit you from every angle and distort your reality

29,47,2021-02-02 14:12:39,changing the rules creating loopholes for gme short position holders ive been noodling on how an institutional trader who opened a short position on gme at $20 or less might wriggle out in my experience when big money gets into trouble like this they print money qe restructure issue bailouts and generally speaking change the rules some things ive seen in the past are 1 dilution gme could issue a new block of shares like 50000000 of them this would dramatically drop the prices as the supply of shares available significantly increased if demand remains about the same i suppose this could come from their treasury of shares or one of the investment banks could underwrite more 2 bailout could uncle jerome step in and cut the boys a big fat check for the money they lost dress it up as some form of quantitative easing 3 debt restructuringbankruptcy create a new fund specifically for the purpose of assuming the debt and declaring bankruptcy what happens to the debt in this case 4 upstairs trading can a us equity short be covered in the otc markets like could a short sale holder cover by buying directly from gamestop at say $25share forgive my ignorance but is there any way to cover a short below the market price maybe in a dark pool or do nbbo rules prevent this in the us equity markets x200b

37,51,2021-02-02 14:03:34,why ebay is going to roll on their earnings by roll on i mean knock out of the fucking park heres some dd for anybody who doesnt eat breath and sleep only gme ebay like most other online retailers are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season thats just a given i am an experienced ebay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years sells around 1520 items the last few months was ridiculous items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 515 watchers would have 2530 with 20 bids the views on each item was double to tripe from early november until pretty much the last two weeks lots of volume lots of selling lots of 10 commissions for ebay now we all saw what happened with apple posting 100 billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3 the next day that shit happens im not a psychic with a magic ball if the market is tanking the market is tanking look at it this week but i will say this the volume on ebay isnt why im going fucking hard in the calls heres the real cherry on top ebay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time every single one of my sales went through paypal along with everybody else every single god damn transaction paypal got their dirty little claws into since i think like the beginning of ebay its just been a given that they give paypal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions well guess what you mother fucker shit had changed since they have now implemented their straight to bank account policy paypal doesnt even exist the money goes you guessed it straight to your account they even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now instead of putting funds into hold on paypal ebay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency for example i have mine setup for each tuesday of every week this is going to and has already saved them millions in fees papa musk has already moved on from paypal its time we do the same oh did i mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well i bought a pokémon card the other day without gay as shit paypal but through god damn apple pay it was way too easy you can also link credit cards bank accounts whatever its 2021 ebay posts earnings in a few days wednesday after close do what you want if the stock goes down call me a retard and make fun of me if the stock goes up fuck off and thank me later look at what it did today ill probably sell a third of my calls on wednesday for an iv hedge as well play at your own risk tldr my positions are ebay call 05feb21 60call 62call and 65call
75,120,2021-02-02 13:53:45,$gme theory so we all understand that if gme is held at a certain place eventually big companies give in and close out their shorts however they are given 2 trading days to do that wednesday ever thought that the reason monday and possibly tuesday will be red is actually the big companies forcing with all their power to lower the price and exit with minimal loss when wednesday comes and then when they close out the short float being extemely low will cause the stock to rocket up again think about it
164,30,2021-02-02 13:35:22,no matter what rh says they fucked up 1 if they were helping their real customer hedge funds they fucked everyone over royally doubt the will ever be proven one way or another but it doesnt matter because 2 if it was due to margin requirements from the ch they fucked up their risk models this is fucking massive this is not the company you should ever consider to hold your cash in either scenario as a customer the minimum you need from a broker is for them to fulfill their obligations rh failed to do this no matter what keep your existing gme in there for now but move your money out and to a different broker as you move out of your positions any cash move out immediately this fuck up may very well bankrupt rh and you dont want to have to wait for the government to send you your check get out get out now get out fast

0,22,2021-02-02 13:16:28,iff updated due diligence and potential huge upside hey you guys sloth well today was quite a day both for the standard gme and for my new favorite stock iff tldr buy iff there is the potential for massive short squeeze gamma squeeze at $150 and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a dupont subsidiary well today iff closed at $130 on strong volume interestingly there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder started at 250pm there must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close the further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock so the options remain affordable for now and in regards to the feb 19 $150 strike calls volume was 40000 with 177000 open will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest or was someone moving them down to march overall it is still looking good for a short squeeze and it is only 15 away from a monster gamma squeeze at $150 so yes hold gme yes i know there are counterfeit gme shares i dont see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though this one on the other hand i expect to rise rapidly with a big pop up after it gets past $150 yesof course i have positions on iff and no this isnt investment advice just a recommendation to check it out yourself
48807,2395,2021-02-02 13:03:05,i suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions tldr melvin and gang hasnt covered shit theyve been illegally closing out their short positions and if we hold they will 100 get fucked there is far more nefarious shit at play so this morning i saw the s3 and ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for gme this absolutely threw me for a loop because friday morning they reported above 120 short interest still i could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close 50 of short positions on such a tightly held stock in one day with very little trading volume in the week this got me digging around to figure out whats up i started by looking into gme failed to delivers ie short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock for the first half of january and i was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of jan gme had 12 million failed to delivers this is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying what was interesting though is that of that 12million 700k shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period i dug further back into the sec failed to deliver reports for gme and saw that pattern extending back months it seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road having spent some time looking at the pattern its clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in then a small chunk of coverage then another large amount and so on to me this looked shady af so i looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article in it a specific section is eerily similar to what weve experienced with gme assuming that xyz eg gme is a hard to borrow security eg apes holding strong and that trader a melvin or its brokerdealer is unable apes again to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at trader as clearing firm rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market trader a might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the brokerdealers closeout requirement but in reality allows trader a to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale most often this is done through the use of a buywrite trade but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term flex options these trades are commonly referred to as reset transactions in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the brokerdealer must purchase or borrow the stock to closeout a fail the transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations such transactions were alleged by the commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firms responsibility to close out a failure to deliver its almost like a play by play of what weve seen in combination with the ladder attacks my guess is well find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of jan comes out on the 17th i 100 think that melvin is committing massive securities fraud in fact i would bet all my money on it oh wait i did 96 gme 290 i am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail more dd not a financial adviser i eat paint chips for dinner edit ok so ive been reading some comments and i wanted to clear a couple things up the failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively so if you sum everything for the jan time period itd come out incorrectly as 5 million what im doing is summing all the debits to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range this process is validated and discussed in other rwsb posts i know etfs could have been redeemed by some mms to gather up gme stock however im not convinced there is enough gme held in etfs to be a significant factor someone in the comments reported this amount to be about 10m we would know if a bunch of etfs rebalanced and dumped gme my number for the ortex short interest was incorrect i got mixed around when i wrote this initially the short interest reported by ortex on friday morning was 80 the 120 figure for s3 was correct please checkout the linked dd it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than i can share this post and the related dd we need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and i think that starts by spreading the word im going to continue to dig into this tonight tomorrow look forward to a new post tomorrow evening if i take an l to 0 i take an l to 0 i dont invest what i cant lose but you can bet your ass ill be holding till this blows open we like the stock 
165,34,2021-02-02 13:01:56,fundamental analysis of gme and an argument for why the speculation is perfectly reasonable hello to all you special fabulous and unsophisticated retail traders i believe people should view gme how they view startups and tech companies with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility im long on gamestop because of changes in leadership their new business strategy and because their fundamentals are actually perfect for company beginning to restructure and transform considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers lets compare gamestop and best buy fundamentals using their october 2020 10qs bby is much bigger than gme isnt currently losing money and no analysts are concerned about them going bankrupt so how do their fundamentals compare they both have relatively strong balance sheets for retailers in 2020 and both companies have almost identical quick ratios and networking capital ratios 5 and 10 their current distribution of their current assets is similar but one huge positive for gme is that their current assets are 375 cash and about 50 inventory which is great for companies beginning to restructure a large cash balance grants the means to launch new company strategies inventory obviouslyhopefully means future revenue for retailers and a conservative net ar balance in 2020 is likely for the best not overestimating how much outstanding revenue can be collected the majority of the current liabilities for gme are ap and accrued expenses which is standard for commercial retail companies however its more important to note relatively low levels of actual current debt long term debt and why the effect of operating leases on total liabilities is bullshit and stupid asc 842 changed how leases are accounted for effective january 2019 so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities so while gmes debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than best buys id argue that its actually better getting out of an operating lease for a small store like gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores best buy leases also being f500 and having a huge market cap skewers de considerably gme has a ton of cash limited debt and operating leases that that can be exited with some relative ease if needed so gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room looking at the income statement and cash flows gme earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic while gamestop has a net income loss they have good gross profits and their gross margin is better than best buy gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold costs directly related to revenue are solid are fundamentally good they just have too many general and administrative nonrevenue producing expenses i wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores also net income loss and loss in cash flows from operating activity in october 2020 was less than 2019 so while its definitely not ideal to see they losses they made significant progress towards having a positive net income in a pandemicrecession and this was still before the ps5 or xbox series x was released in november gme had a positive total cash flow but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies think of a mcdonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow but i believe it will be good for them this is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer which i believe will ultimately make them profitable again if you dont believe me you can read exactly what their plan is ryan cohen and other chewy executives did not invest and join the gamestonk board for the lulz they liked gmes plan and the unique opportunity that gamestop presents kind of like all of us shitheads here i think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve ecommerce sales the business strategy from their october 2020 10q business strategy in may of 2019 we announced our multiyear transformation initiative which we refer to as gamestop reboot to position gamestop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets optimize the core business improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization including cost

other investments are expected to among other things provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omnichannel retail platform i still think shorts did not cover red days are meaningless short ladders theres probably counterfeit shares floating around and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze but totally forgetting all that for a second when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price a ton of startups and tech companies that ipo trade wildly higher than their fundamentals a big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership look at elon and renewable energy or portnoy and mobile sports betting why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity great executive leadership and in an emerging industry any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that arent profitable whats the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company ipoing based on all of my fundamental analysis i feel comfortable setting a price target and sell limit of $6942069 cause stonk im so behind on my work from today because i cant stop thinking about gamestonk and watching the price and volume on think or swim diamond hands forever but i need a break for a few days let me know if my dd is shit and someone please message me if we hit my pt this week andor if steve cohen gets sent to rikers ty and power to the playerzzz i am in no way shape or form recommending that you buy hold or sell any security im under the influence of several legal substances dont any of this seriously i am using publicly

70,59,2021-02-02 12:54:12,when will the gme squeeze be squoze what is the endgame found an interesting article thought you retards might want to see edit i like this stock and im holding until pluto tldr i think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their gme shorts till march 2021 ask yourself if youre willing to hold and outlast them if the answer to that is yes you can do something truly impactful here that only gme can make happen if the answer is no then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners some people will go home losers and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because thats what they do f not financial advice i dont know anything
205,30,2021-02-02 12:43:46,short ladder for smoothest brains you and karen tell your boss you are going to buy all the houses in green meadows eden gme because it is the only place that boss can build a lithium mine and boss sold millions of contracts for lithium that he needs to deliver you and karen start buying houses at fair market value and selling them again for 10 less than fair market value residents see housing values fall and panic and think they need to sell to avoid being the last worthless house you and karen keep buying and selling the same set of houses at cheaper and cheaper prices some paper handed idiots sell their grandpas farm because fmv keeps tanking if the ladder attack is successful you and karen buy all the houses on the cheap because you need them and you successfully tanked the housing market in gme if you and karen are the smoothest brains in the world people catch on buy the houses you are discounting for cheaper and cheaper and you need to offer more and more and more to buy the property because everyone realized you needed the houses and some retail autist bought the houses you were trying to tank on the cheap eventually after paying a shit ton of closing costs interest on the houses you are making no progress in buying the actual property you need and you need to start paying the inflated housing values for the property if people panic and sell on the cheap win for hf if people laugh and say suck it melvin then the property price rises and you get paid should karen win

146,40,2021-02-02 12:23:57,they say robinhood stopped its users from buying gme because of requirement with clearinghouse so now that the bleeding has stopped and the frenzy has subsided there are fund managers articles and former td ameritrade ceo coming out on cnbc giving reasons why robinhood halted trading for gme and other stocks lets just go over the order of events that happened and the not so subtle incentives behind this yesterday in the clubhouse video chat elon musk called out vlad tenev on this he replied by saying something along the lines of regulatory requirement and to protect the users etc the most egregious thing he said was he didnt want to halt trading altogether so he stopped buying only to protect robinhood and the clearinghouse there is some credibility to this logic but the way the events unfolded is suspicious and it is clear that this was not the thought process at the time of the decision and it was after the fact they came up with this to try to explain the real reason first of all who benefits from halting the buying only hedgefunds i think we would have all been upset but we would not have been harmed if robinhood halted trading for gme completely if rh halted gme trading altogether until they secured more funding to meet requirements then i would have believed the excuse they gave that they put restrictions to meet regulatory requirements tldr rh halted buying that only benefited hedge funds and harmed retail investors that bought into gme and then after the fact they came out and said regulatory requirements if you really didnt have any ulterior motive then why didnt rh warn us or give us a heads up this was not a instant phenomenon it was inevitable event that was building up over days the volume was picking up and everyone knew what was going on are you seriously trying to tell me that all the people are rh had no idea about these deposit or regulatory requirements until 1100 am of the day did they have to suddenly put these restrictions midday and directly cause a massive price drop in gme why couldnt they give these reasons at the time of halting trading its clear at this point vlad tenev risked jail time to put restrictions on trading that only benefited hedge funds and directly harmed retail investors that already had money in gme i do not support rh and this ceo should be investigated

296,207,2021-02-02 11:39:04,lets leave the propaganda and conspiracies out of this and pretend we have wrinkley brains for just a minute lets practice some critical thinking in all this commotion a few glaring questions remains ive noticed these questions are repeatedly being addressed and answered with grand conspiracies that implicate major legal and ethical improprieties first off cnbc and now other news networks have been reporting since last week that melvin closed their position this sub has repeatedly stated that this is fake news and melvin trying to manipulate markets people in this sub are pointing to the volume and the short interest estimates and saying its impossible that theyve closed if its that easy to fact check something like this how stupid would melvin have to assume the media and the retail traders are obviously if its that easy to fact check it cnbc and other networks would know if they are lying so is the implication that these networks are blatantly lying on the hedge funds behalf wouldnt somebody at the network say ummm these retail traders can look at the volume and see it hasnt been closed we are not lying for you when its so obviously a lie this leads me to my next question which is related to last weeks surge in price the run up in price last week looked like a short squeeze remember this stock was trading in the teens a few weeks ago that run up coincides with the timeline of when melvin and cnbc are saying melvin closed could that run up in price have been the short squeeze caused by melvin closing im holding strong added more shares today but i wanted to start this thread because it feels like the gme thread is full of propaganda and conspiracies i wanted a refuge of critical thinking in this sub ive enjoyed for all these years if the accusations being thrown at the media and the hedge funds is true these are big time concerns for the general public if the conspiracies and propaganda on this sub are going to cost people significant savings thats also an issue usually the truth lies somewhere in between so im hoping this sub can cut through the noise and seek the truth i dont want this to come across as me raining on the parade either i have no idea whats going on but ive been buying shares on each dip because i like the stock

88,11,2021-02-02 11:16:54,robinhoods regulations led to me taking on more risk sup tards today i had 83 shares 2 debit spreads and about 5k cash because rh is corrupt i couldnt buy any more shares i planned on transferring to fidelity but my funds wouldnt settle until thursday so depending on the withdrawal time i might not have my funds in fidelity until next week and i wanted to get in on the dip i wouldve just bought more shares but again corrupt fuck rh i hope vlad goes to prison anyways i tried to buy another debit spread buy the 25 240 call sell the 300 call limited upside but also limited downside well those whores wouldnt let me bc technically my other spreads count as 4 contracts the fuk and youre only allowed to have 5 contactsthe fuk so i ended up buying the 25 265 call obviously im getting porked on it right now and it dawned on me that those fuckers are supposedly limiting my buying in my best interest when in reality it wouldve been in my best interest to let me do what i fucking want with my own money and buy the other leg of my spread id be down a helluva lot less if rh let me trade freely so in my mind that makes it one of 2 things theyre either a completely in bed with mms and hedge funds when they say being there for our customers theyre talking about citadel b complete pussies clearinghouses put pressure on them by raising deposit requirements and rh says yes daddy they put up no fight they dont stick their neck out for customers at all they roll over and lie about their bitchness take your pick either way im gtfo as soon as the squeeze is squoze gme to the moon diamond fuckin hands lets make rh go broke

261,52,2021-02-02 11:10:58,a message to wsb first off i want to say how proud i am of you retards ive been watching people lose their entire life savings and still hold the line i joined wsb in december have been lurking for months prior with my buddies and fuck has the time flown i cant believe how much time and money ive invested into this subreddit one point i just wanted to mention is if the brokers and mms somehow manage to get away with very illegal market manipulation in the open and in front of the entire internet i personally wont be throwing the majority of my paychecks into the stock market anymore before the comments section obliterates both my selfrespect and karma i just have to mention that i definitely cant be alone in this weve had 6 million users join us in the past month alone also over 50 of robinhood users own gme this isnt just some ordinary situation where wsb loses money this is a war between the corrupt 1 on wall street and the entire rest of the world ive seen thousands of posts from people joining the cause from countries i cant even pronounce us coming out on the losing end of this one would just solidify to millennials and zoomers everywhere that gambling our money in the stock market wouldnt benefit us why would anyone be willing to play a game that is rigged against them that being said i truly do naively believe that the sec or congress will have to step in and chalk up a win for the fellas on wsb soon if they dont thats potentially millions of people and tens if not hundreds of billions that our future generation wont be willing to invest in our economy just because the market could be manipulated against us without any serious repercussions but until that point youll have to pry my 100 shares of gme at $8700 from my lifeless body if you think im going to abandon ship now its a cheap price to pay for some long overdue justice not only for ourselves but for everyone in 08 furthermore youd be very wrong if you think im ever leaving this community full of wonderful regular people trying to do something better with their lives loss porn is the only thing that gets me hard anymore and we all know there will always be plenty of that to go around here hold the line ill either be with you all on the moon or in the unemployment line good luck and godspeed retards
70,50,2021-02-02 11:10:03,theory paper hands might actually benefit diamond hands were talking gme here as we know the short squeeze ss is not a matter of if its a matter of when the hfs know this wsb users that know half a thing about the stock market know this now the goal of the hf isnt to cancel the ss its to make it as less expensive as possible for them in other words here is what their bloomberg terminal screen is showing now comes my theory paper hands aka people acting on emotion because of fud and panic rather than what the numbers say volume technical analysic etc are benefitting both us and hf by selling at a loss or a meager price anything less than 1k$ is free money remember theyre allowing hf to cover their shorts for cheaper lets say the hf have a price target on gme of 1000$ in other words their harvard quants calculated that at a certain point they could cover all their shorts and make the ss happen until gme hits 1000 what i call the dday after that point they will no longer need to buy anymore shares ending their torture they would have covered most of their shorts without going bankrupt that means that their goal will be to tire us spread fud throw ladder attacks until they can quickly cover their shorts from whatever the price will be to 1000$ supposing 1000$ is the price they calculated is the more beneficial the hf goal is to not go bankrupt therefore paper hands selling their shares could make the ss happen faster by giving more shares to hf while giving us more shares for cheap naturally until the dday its a winwin scenario for diamond hands whether paper hands sell or not the ss will happen disclaimer i know nothing about the stock market im just theorizing what do everyone thinks of this tldr paper hands selling might make the ss happen faster for holders as long as there isnt too many of them
84,16,2021-02-02 11:05:01,owning more than 100 of a company and you how to generate unlimited gainz so ive been thinking with all this bullshit about short selling what if you owned more than 100 of a company thanks to short selling its actually possible since short selling effectively creates more shares even legitimate short selling where shares shorted are borrowed so how can you cash in if you own more than 100 of a company easy just gift the company some money and immediately pay it out in the form of dividends youll receive more from the dividends then you put in thanks to the extra shares you got from the short sellers who have to make payments in lieu of dividends allowing you to do the same process again with even more money of course to do this you dont even need to own over 100 you can work with other shareholders to pull off this trick too so long as the group together owns more than 100 of the company in short short selling is stupid gme to the

66,15,2021-02-02 10:40:53,stop me if i am wrong but are we greater fools to be investing in gme if retard really means greater fool im proud to be a retard with all of you the greater fool is an economic term the means essentially people will buy something not because they believe that it is worth the price but rather because they believe that they will be able to sell it to someone else at an even higher price i believe that most people spend their lives and their savings to be conservative with their investments and not try to be the greater fool they want to sit comfortably and ensure their retirement with the purpose of safety but we are investing in something with a purpose to screw over those guys in their high towers laughing at us for being greater fools because of it a few platforms put trade restrictions because they were scared and cowardly from their losses they felt how we did during the 2008 financial crisis i am reluctant to post this because i am an amateur investor practicing nothing but conservative longterm trades but today i took a chancea really risky chance that may not pay out for me well us in the endi bought a bit of gme what some may think is not that much but for me its a down payment on a house its a new car its remodel on a house i do believe what we are doing will definitely be in case studies in business schools possibly history books but i believe what we are doing is great were doing what those hedge fund guys didnt think we had the balls or the means to do it temporarily paid off for us in the short im hoping it will pay off for us in the long term the newsroom was right when sloan sabbath said this country was built of greater fools im really proud to be a part of something with you all diamond hands retards and greater fools
79,82,2021-02-02 10:37:46,theyre using etfs to fuel the short ladders low effort dd on $gme and why no squeeze hey dipshits take a look at theses etfs notice anything weird about their charts the hfs are purchasing etfs that have exposure to gme and are redeeming the shares inside of them to get access to the rights to a gme stock theyre using the redemption rights from the etfs to then sell the stock without directly influencing the price of gme heres some proof from the top four etfs with exposure to gme 1gamr 2xsvm 3rwj 4xrt this is likely the reason were not seeing the other side of their short ladder attacks theyre buying exposure from the etfs and dumping the redemption rights to flood the market this is not investment advice im long $gme edit

203,30,2021-02-02 10:13:37,gme failuretodeliver for jan 115 was at least 113 million that post that claimed that 5 million shares of gme failed to deliver in the first half of the month was wrong they made the big brain move of summing a running total but we can still get an idea of how many shares failed to deliver with some better math heres the data from the sec each failures number is previous days failures new failures settled failures date failures diff from previous day 14 182269 15 490723 308454 16 772112 281389 17 799328 27216 18 555658 243670 111 703110 147452 112 287730 415380 113 662524 374794 114 621483 41041 we know that if n more shares failed to deliver on a given day than the previous day then at least n new failures to deliver occurred maybe more but those got cancelled out by settlements therefore we can sum the positive differences and get a lower bound on how many failures occurred doing so we get that at least 113 million gme shares failed to deliver in the first half of january remember this is a lower bound as we didnt count the failures that were cancelled out by settlements it aint the 5 million that the other math whiz calculated but 113 million aint nothing to sneeze at what does that tell me hold baby hold disclaimer this is not financial advice position is 78 gme $25
57,51,2021-02-02 10:11:29,how hedge funds can close position without affecting the gme volume so i am a smooth brain retard who doesnt know much but i was curious as to how can short interest decrease when the volume was so low turns out wall street has a technique called etf stripping where they can buy etfs with significant allocation to gme strip gme stocks and use those shares to close their positions you can find more info from this article ps as i mentioned i am not an expert i will urge industry experts to correct me if i am wrong or expand this post by adding more context in the comment section
7977,200,2021-02-02 10:06:38,we need the same outrage over ladder attacks as we had over robinhood limiting purchases  just got off the phone with both of the nevada senators offices every one of you needs to do the same when robinhood restricted trading last thursday the reaction across the entire country was swift so why the fuck have short sellers been allowed to continue to engage in plain sight in short ladder attacks for six fucking days its not even like it would be hard for the sec to investigate but shocker theyre clearly letting it continue the fact that the same fucks who defunded the country in 2008 and made these risky bets on gme in the first place are now committing illegal acts in broad daylight is the biggest slap in the face yet call your senators representatives governors blow up portnoy chamath elon aoc maybe even ted cruz position 16 shares gme edit as this post is getting a little attention im including this really quality post on the same subject that provides a template to discuss 1 what is happening and 2 the specific laws demonstrating illegality with your representatives 
35744,1267,2021-02-02 10:00:52,please stop promoting belfort i get it a famous person doing memes in our favor is fun we all love the wolf of wall street movie but lets be real here belfort is the epitome of what were up against as retail hes a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didnt just get a slap on wrist from the sec he actually went to prison he was just antigme a few days ago and now hes memeing in its favor a meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub its pretty clear to me belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund theres power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk he sees the popularity and realizes the potential and impact that crowd sourced dd will do he knows communities like this will grow and he wants to use you this is nothing more than seedy opportunist bullshit because belfort realizes youre the exact type of person who makes him rich a retard who yolos into risky investments at the idea of massive gains he wants to capitalize on the popularity of gme and this sub he wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his mindset when really he got rich by scamming people and famous for being caught please stop he is not your friend i wouldnt be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a trading community of his own belfort will share his favourite market sector in wolf report and give 10 lessons in wolf mentality which includes tips on what it takes to be a trader how to handle emotions the intangibles of success how to take advantage of opportunities and how to learn from your mistakes yeah how about you eat my stinky dick instead i want nothing to do with this shit and this sub should not be strengthening any kind of association with criminals of the finance world
168,51,2021-02-02 09:59:32,how to actually fk the hedge funds over someone just posted that lots of $800 calls were bought with 319 expiry another post mentioned that short interest is down but why it might be misleading what do these 2 posts have to do with what im abojt to say basically it is extremely likely that hedge funds are literally hedging their short positions by buying calls at $800 strike $25m worth of calls according to that first post i copied this is a huge opportunity to make them eat even larger losses 1 they havent really covered their shorts by closing their original position therefore they will continue paying interest to short gme and how long is that sustainable 2 they covered their short position by buying $25m worth of calls which we could make worthless if gme doesnt reach $800 by 319 but what if gme goes to $400 or iv goes up so that they sell their options at a profit good question this is the main problem but to counter that we do exactly what weve been doing hold and buy at dips only this means gmes stock price should be relatively stable and as a result hedge funds will lose on both their short and long positions i know this means gme wont go to the moon until 319 but after 319 it will moon like crazy because hedge funds will take a huge hit youve already seen that screenshot of melvin point 72 and citadel taking double digit losses in january lets make it triple digits tldr to make the hedge funds lose we keep gme stock price stable to do that hold and buy at dips only
68,30,2021-02-02 09:59:17,wsj is looking for quotes lets help them out as per the title apparently you need a click bait username and some outrageous position that makes it look like you are a complete degenerate gambler media outlets arent even doing validation of the bs they post x200b here is my line please use your influence of the boomer segment to help new retards find value in gme we love the stock my actual username is uthic_dic_gme_gang_69 and my quotable line is i have 690 gme shares and purposely changed my password to something that i cant remember so that i cant sell planning to do an account recovery and sell on friday also for reference i failed 10th grade math
147,161,2021-02-02 09:54:21,technical analysis of gme and reality check disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and nor am i writing this as financial advice this is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with gme many of you will hate my perspective you will call me a insert rainbow bear emoji i am write these on word so yeah you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud but all i am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into and sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective i also want to say that i am extremely proud of this sub this sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter however this is a sub that was built on due diligence degenerate trading and crazy gains and loss porn and to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of however the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the moass which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so this was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading i for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you and like many of you i made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of january it is life changing money there is an old saying in the industry and within trading that you ride the trade until it doesnt make sense anymore and i am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point so below you will find my technical analysis on gme and why i feel like it might continue its downward trend this is of course is subject to change and just my observations i hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts technical analysis my technical analysis approach i am an intermediate term momentum trader this simply means that i am trying to trade for the next 515 days the tools i use are the following rsi measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum macd this is trendfollowing momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securitys price and helps you understand the momentum of a stock volume speaks for itself mvwap sma helps identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorterterm trend mvwap pink line sma teal line i usually use a mix of the 15 30 minute chart paired with the 1 hour to identify patterns within the market chart a below you will find the 15minute chart that spreads over the past five days of trading each data point represents a 15minute segment of trading the black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent premarket and afterhours trading x200b chart a 15 minute intervals tuesday of charta shows extremely bullish pattern being built late tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours this was the culmination of papa elon and camath chipping in their two cents on twitter along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers this very well could have been melvin and the early shorts covering their positions additionally we can see that the vwap and sma are diverging further apart bulllish the macd is showing the same as well with the histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well bullish and despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on wednesday we still managed to end the day green however we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff and we all know what happened there after ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock andor there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security furthermore we can see that during the thursday trading session that three bearish events occur 1 the mvwap and sma begin to diverge 2macd plummets with a bearish signal line crossover and 3 the rsi plummets to sold territory as well to further support my hypothesis i have included the 1 hour chart as well x200b chart b 1 hour trading intervals as we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term 1 hour chart only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period 1 hour intervals and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading at this time we can see that the mvwap and sma have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence that the rsi has neared oversold territory anything below 30 is considered oversold and finally the longer term macd is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside as i said earlier you ride the trade until it doesnt make sense anymore and based off my research i can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside which is why on friday i started to trim most of my positions in gme it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security today i trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from gme at this time i hope i am wrong i hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon i would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another gamma ramp but right now from my point of view that is not where we are again these are just my observations and i know a lot of you will find this offensive but if you are going to trade or invest you have to remove your emotions from the picture be a fucking robot for those that are going to ask the trading platform i use is think or swim positions no calls left in the hopper only shares about 1500 $19

933,91,2021-02-02 09:21:20,comprehensive gme diamond hand strategy guide if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle sun tzu were in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in america with our gme short squeeze proxy war and if you autists want to win this war you need to know the enemy and know yourselffirstly education is key so if youre new you definitely need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is what the enemy is doing 1 price manipulation with short ladder attacks they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume there are several reasons why they are doing this 1 scare off paper hand bitches they prey on people who jumped on gme without even knowing what a short squeeze is they see price fall they paper hands and they get out 2 make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions 3 price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock cuz we be holding sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher all the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions making this cycle not doable indefinitely 2 media manipulation 1 most if not all american main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests simply by the false narratives they are reporting are not to be trusted and if seen can dishearten and shake the will of those who dont have diamond hands best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch some examples of false narratives are 1 reddit is made up of altrights or idiots or gamblers etc were not idiots because were the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack were retards and autists who love the stock and the company that is all 2 reddit is moving on to silver silver cannot be squeezed with a market cap of more than $15 trillion there is no way for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that the only possible short squeeze play is gme because its a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of july 2020 so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on wsb to affect the price of a small cap company stock literally all the posts on reddit promoting slvr are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts plus citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this gme war youre shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy slvr 3 xxx is the next gme this is also a false narrative nothing can be the next gme because nothing is shorted as much as gme which is still over 100 shorted gme is a once in a lifetime opportunity gain for us and loss for them 4 shorts have covered their position another false narrative short interest is still over at 100 and there are multiple wsb posts that explain this another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short 3 breaking the law some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation ie freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling they can spin it however they want but as far as i know it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash and if the situation is desparate enough theyll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69420 expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end 4 social media manipulation hedge funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands some places they target is wsb itself other stock trading subreddits facebook and on sites apps like webull and yahoo finance dont believe in random comments always believe in wsb posts with huge amounts of likes top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here by mods too to make sure theyre factual 5 their current strategy wallstreet calls us dumb money because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck and we have short attention spans theyll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways or continuous short ladder attacks trying to scare paper hands into selling and bore diamond hands into selling as well they will also try to tempt us with other next gme type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two ie silver to try and get people to hop off the gme rocket theyll use media to continue to push narratives that the gme short squeeze is over short positions are covered and redditors have moved onto something else if this fails then they may simulate a squeeze by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800 then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen to simulate the sell off so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top so they will all sell but if people just look at the volume theyll know its all a ruse x200b x200b what were doing our advantage and why the enemy cant win 1 this is a movement this has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze this has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1 vs the 99 the common people news agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this we have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together we even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well we have billboards being bought all over the country airplanes flying banners about gme a global movement will crush any hedge fund 2 we are holding and were continuing to buy we are getting smarter tougher and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands we managed to hold during the short attack to $110 on thursday and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages they will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching the volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks and not us selling due to tiny tiny volumes also we are continuing to buy calls on gme to increase upward pressure no one here has stopped buying 3 nuclear bomb still undetonated short squeeze still coming it hasnt happened yet we know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered 4 enemy loses money everyday we dont it costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high melvin down over 50 just this month alone you think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees we dont have to pay anything for holding our stocks we can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money so thats why there will come a time where its cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out i dont think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress i believe in feb we will see some major action it could even start as early as tomorrow because thats the last day shorts have to cover their 129 puts that expired 5 were not breaking the laws they are recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of counterfit stocks circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up insane short interest set up for short squeeze we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market you bet that the government and sec will be involved soon if this is true and things will explode to the stratosphere read the following and ponder yourself im not a financial advisor just a dumb ape 6 were getting smarter everyday we get new dd on wsb and more and more people are reading these dds and understand how to diamond hands and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media weve just hit 8 mil subs our subs are going exponential weve recovered from the rh fiasco and were primed and loaded on other brokerages like fidelity we are more ready than ever to continue this war and this fight 7 an apes move this week again not financial advice but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape the autistic ape would buy the dips especially at this insane discount price of around $100 the autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the gme train past $1k easily 10x their bananas those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month the autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks but the autistic ape will ask itself is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas most apes will answer yes but the ape knows if they buy it they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month but those red number are just fake numbers generated by hft short ladder attacks and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas because apes together stronk tldr ps you only lose if you sell stock stays down for a month then rockets up in march no loss only historical profits for retail investors

28,20,2021-02-03 01:28:07,robinhood alternative that doesnt suck dingleberries during the chaos of the last few days many of us tards have been left wondering where to move instead of robinhood robinhood can suck my unwashed taint but where can i find an app that still makes my 3 brain wrinkles tingle and doesnt have a ui that looks like a hospital intranet from 1995 sorry fidelity but your platform is a massive piece of shit the answer i just found is public it has a nice ui thats easy to understand like robinhood but instead of cutting off its basic services when the going gets tough they actually pushed back on the powers at be to keep unrestricted access to our precious gme and its associates during last weeks shitstorm so is this an advertisement for public yeah i guess so im not going to plug a ref link in here because im not an autistic garbage boy but i will say that its pretty dope huge added plus theres a social aspect to it where you can comment on trades and see what people are doing this is most important because you can see when people paper hand and see how much they lost screenshot of some fucking bungus paper handing his position so theyve got a built in gainloss porn feature which is hype because thats basically what were all about here tldr theres a robinhood adjacent app with a built in gainloss porn feature called public and it isnt one of the dinosaur platforms with a ui that looks like a 1990s book store website also you can buy as much gme as you want while you laugh at the people losing 70 after holding for 2 days positions all in gme 
232,47,2021-02-03 01:12:52,sweet just picked up some gme and amc during the dip to the mooooooooon volume on gme still looks too low to match the dip in price btw this is not financial advice dont listen to this retard i actually dont know anything about stonks 
666,148,2021-02-03 01:10:56,why gme is down fellow retards bagholders ulansman grandma and paperhands lets look at the facts 1 short according to s3 is still at 122 2 robinhood is still not allowing users to trade securities freely these include $gme which artificially creates selling pressure they are currently raising money to have capital on hand or liquidity to allow users to freely trade all positions again as soon as this happens $gme will similar to friday 3 all users who transferred their accounts from robinhood to other brokerages still need time it takes 35 days on average meaning eow the first users will be able to buy stocks freely again those will include $gme this will create another spike in gamestop i heard fidelity is great i personally use tda etrade 4 volume is low meaning all the restrictions they placed on users to exclude them from free market access obviously worked but the real diamond hands arent selling as soon as people realize they made a mistake people will pile in this will happen latest eow as brokerages allow users to trade the stocks again and call options expire another spike will probably trigger hfs to finally cover their short positions again as they currently believe they have won the fight and successfully diverted our attention 5 they got you right they destroyed your believe in the short squeeze see how you feel thats exactly what they wanted dont call the fight yet this is round 4 of 12 we will knock them out soon just hold tight and buy what you can this dip will not last long and you will bite your ass when $gme rockets to $1000 disclaimer this is not financial advise i am retarded $gme positions gme average $12844 and $amc calls
1,5,2021-02-03 01:09:32,some thoughts on silver gme and game changing events with dragons and stuff  disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice i barely understand how the stock market works professionally im a computational researcher my job is to simulate complex systems that my smooth brain barely understands okay fellow retards loooong time lurker and europoor autist so excuse my spelling lets brake some things down silver its a real well played scheme on this you have to remember there is a dragon in the east where people have a historically deep bonding to silver and the dragon looooves to take a gamble so number one priority for melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon from gme with shiny silver imagine hfs did not throatfuck gme on thursday and the dragon banged into the marked heavy this uprising of the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late wednesday early thursday if hfs didnt screw the market exactly this moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets they would have already been toast besides that try to find silver shortsput options for a reasonable spreadprice which are also available to buy i tried the whole day yesterday but at least at my europoor broker i couldnt find a single one what tells you that looks like smart money is not buying the silver rush x200b anti gme bots these guys are getting their bots more and more angry and aggressive over the last 24h but why would they still take the effort if they already hit their targets all this shows to my retarded autist smooth brain is that they are in deep fear hey bot guys i just want to quote one of your clients whats your beef with me im just trying to make a living just like you i hope you guys got payed in advance because your clients will likely go out of business anyways just to repeat the obvious they try to create fear among you retards and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper to close this part i just want to quote some famous investor from omaha be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful im an autist i dont feel fearful at all i simply cant but for some reason the bot guys are they seem fearful as fuck to me x200b short interest ratios so i hope most of you guys realized they simply changed the formula to calculate si rates its basically still 120 in science you would say they normalized the standardization you take your observed value also into account and add it to your base value eventually your maximum number can only be 1 or in other terms 100 in this specific case you take your number of shorted stocks and add them to the float as a base value then you divide your number of shorted stocks by the base value including shorted stocks which can only be smaller then 1 or 100 in respective inflate the base to make things look completely different anyways my smooth brain is able to convert the equation to the old standard shortsfloat which is based on s3s latest 55 short interest rate just to make it easy for your autist brains shortsshorts float 055 045055 shorts float 081 shorts float shorts 1081 float 123 float or 123 of float in addition you have to keep in mind big players always have taken fines and trials into consideration as costs i dont know what the fines for misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are but if you are scared to death you should first of all not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by recruiting bot armies obviously lying silver bullshit other fud you name it and you are willing to take any risk to survive or fines in this kind of situation probably any kind of fines no matter what x200b x200b but why would they do this whats their business with the hfs you ask yourself you guys are threatening soooo many business models in finance and this is the real game changer keep in mind on stock markets you mainly trade the future you have to make scenarios for the upcoming future and there is a horrifying scenario for boomer financial services arising at the horizon but first lets bring it to the crucial point first look for information asymmetries google it or whatever thats what its all about in the end thats the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small players its all about information sovereignty or the information monopoly however you call it the one who is quicker capable to gather more accurate information and hide it from others wins like buying your investment decisions and order limits from robinhood sometimes its even enough to convince your enemy that you are in possession of better information by the way this fight about information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now hfs try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate information about the whole situation so lets come back to the bullet point imagine a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more accurate information and take investment decisions on that because of declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it this will drastically change the current state of the market in means of clients to financial service provider relations making it a more liberated fairer market in some kind the whole industry would lose trillions in the future so yeah you guys did it you scared a big chunk of the whole financial sector not with gme in particular but with this way of investing therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition process must be stopped and delayed at any cost this is literally the clusterfuck for boomer financial services and the worldwide media and wsb are the battlegrounds right now x200b x200b but hey im just a short minded stock loving retard having a lot of fun on this gme to the moon planing to buy some dips today because im way to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short ladder ping pong x200b x200b tldr gme trillions to the moon
429,34,2021-02-03 01:08:52,buy the dip i do not believe for one second that these greedy fucks have covered over 60 of their short interest on these low volume down days but even if they did you better believe that what were seeing this morning is them doubling down and naked short selling once again if you sell today youre going to regret it for the rest of your life these greedy hfs can only pull so many shares out of their ass before they will be out of ammo theyre just trying to lower the price so they can 1 cover at the lowest price possible 2 buy the shares they need to deliver by today for all the calls that were exercised friday at the lo 3 lowest price possible x200b there is no way the real short interest percentage is 53 but even if it is thats still high af you think these greedy hfs are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone right now they think they have you on the ropes so theyre tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down you know what that means theyre shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is wayyy more risky its super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for gme without even taking into consideration the squeeze x200b x200b were in a desert right now and the hfs are dying of thirst and we have the water are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut fuck no these guys have screwed us over for so long and were going to give in and let them win there is no way in hell that if we just hold that we dont go to the moon x200b x200b how many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver theyre literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and were not going to believe their bs theyre eventually going to have to pay back these shares and were going to make them pay our price for them x200b x200b buy low sell high do you have cash in your account buy low when youre buying you should probably feel a little hesitant thats how you know youre getting a good deal holding shares dont sell youre supposed to sell high not sell low you dumb fuck x200b x200b this will be the defining moment of this sub you better believe that the smart money on wall street is buying right now are you going to join them on this rocket ship to the moon or are you going to pussy out and step off the spacecraft right before take off x200b x200b im not a financial advisor do your own dd x200b positions gme shares
0,35,2021-02-03 01:06:00,im shorting gme unpopular opinion gme is going down most of this is greed and shorting is normal so sure sticking it to wall street and burning shorts may be ok big wall street traders do manipulate and exploit financial instruments and stock prices however most of the buying movement in gme is personal greed shorts perform an important and healthy function in a market if they are wrong they provide stocks at a cheaper price for you bankruptcy doesnt always destroy a business if the underlying is good instead it reorganizes it wallstreetbets used to be about young males trying to look retarded and not taking themselves too seriously now its actual cringe with financially illiterate straw grasping and interpretation of anything not going your way as a literal malicious conspiracy the market isnt a democracy ive shorted gme and trust me the money in shorts can crush any number of regular folk if i am right this post is far more beneficial than these silly fan fiction grade posts about the stock market
0,40,2021-02-03 01:05:26,ill take the downvotes i dont mind but someone has to say it while i love that gme has brought a ton of community and united many of us to a singular cause please be responsible i see a lot of diamond hands chatter but the fact is that many brothers in here stand to lose a lot of cash there will be other opportunities take a moment reset and wait for the next stock that we just like the market isnt going anywhere the gme ride has given us a glimpse of how much power retail investors have its better wielded as a focused effort
316,50,2021-02-03 03:04:21,the hedgies did not give up and suddenly change their hedgie ways they are doubling up on shorts everything expecting us to fold buy the dips these hfts do not run on emotions they run on algorithms and statistics if they think a price is ballooning they will short it they all doubt these prices will hold and continued they are leveraged between each other and strategizing amongst themselves to profit off a bubble every single wsb stock has been shorted out the ass over the last week $gme $amc $bb $exprand all the rest they are moving as one every single dip retail traders with are acquiring an increasing share of the float at some point the hedge funds are all just trading borrowed shares amongst each other the more you buy and hold the less power they have and the more shares theyre going to need to reacquire they dont want you to know it but wsb is a powerful decentralized hedge fund an average of 4 shares each is all it will take for this sub to become the largest controlling interest of the gme float and the rest cant afford $gme shares wait for a dip or buy one of the other stocks theyre spreading their risk over all of them every time you buy the dip and hold shares they are digging themselves into a deeper hole remember that short interest data youve seen until now is total bs the firms do not report short data for last month until tonight at 6pm and the results wont be made public until 29 s3 and the others are putting out completely arbitrary speculations based on computer models in reality they have no idea because the numbers havent been reported yet buy the damn dips hold this is not financial advice im retarded

35,1,2021-02-03 01:40:31,do not let them divide and conquer their strategy is simple restrict buying inflow which allows low volume sell pressure to crater the stock not only does this kill morale it also triggers a bunch of margin calls allowing them to take away more shares that they desperately need what to do im holding but that may not be enough there seems to be a lot noise about if they closed their shorts or not no one will know definitively until the official numbers are out there was huge volume at the end of friday i assume its possible a portion was covered then if they continue to restrict shares we are looking to buy over a long enough period of time they will win unless we buy the fucking dip and hold to our convictions war isnt pretty i know that weve made a statement but so many times has the world forgotten about the latest social movement just because the higher ups know that time kills unity and motivation in times of fud buy if you can hold at will and continue to learn most importantly dont lose what you cant afford to good luck everyone gme 
35,3,2021-02-03 01:38:59,from wendys to tendies a story of how i got my   i never really make story time posts like this but it feels appropriate and cathartic today once upon a time i made over a million dollars from a very early investment off a wendys paycheck into fairly well known digital currency automod preventing the name no thats not where the money came from in my other posts i lost that million completely i was wallstreetbets before this existed i literally found out and learned about said currency from 4chan b i lost it because when it peaked and fell i sold for other currencies then those fell i didnt trust my gut if i held i would have multi millions by todays price that said i didnt have my yet i got into gme because of extensive research throughout last year i bought in and kept averaging since november i liked michael burrys viewpoint i like ryan cohen and believe he can do big things and i love gamestech basically i like this stock i never once viewed this stock as a short squeeze play or anything like that being overly shorted was what made me confident i had a good entry point in a future value company something the public had not yet accepted people still thought it was brickandmortar only that said something smells there is plenty of dd on this sub and others so i really dont need to restate things but ill briefly break it down the numbers here dont add up the volume and price dont make sense the story is still wrong brick and mortar how can they push this still the media lies silver being pushed by reddit i really have no true clue what the outcome will be everyone at this time is hoping for a short squeeze and maybe it will come to that i hope it does that will be pretty fun to watch and maybe ill get to be in the movie but if it doesnt do some other kinds of research you might find that gme has a future outside of being a meme quite frankly its not a meme even now so i knew i could do this i knew i found my stay strong you might have a smooth brain but you have a strong gut believe in your gut and follow your conviction lastly a quote i read last year that feels appropriate now dont ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up robert frost wsb took a fence down and maybe just maybe we are starting to see why it was put up in the first place

101,7,2021-02-03 01:45:59,why gme and amc holders need to be looking at on balance volume to have an idea of whats going on with these volume and price movements a little helpful dd newbies skip this paragraph nonnewbies and people who actually bothered to do 5 minutes of research about volume price movements the tldr is that the gradient for obv is not proportional to the gradient of the price decrease indicating a bullish divergence i got a few pms about my last post and what that little blue line called on balance volume or obv means obv basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up or going down at that time so in theory when price rises obv should rise at the same rate to that increase and vice versa however the useful thing about obv is in the name its weighted by volume this means the more shares that are boughtsold the steeper the obv line or gradient so in this gamestop selling run we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors theoretically however the obv line has barely moved what this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for comparing it to the first obv rise last week when everyone bought into gme this in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now but what are the statistics in todays price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact obv against a total balance of 11 billion thats a factor of 05 and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25 last week thats why everyone here is going on about volume there isnt any if youre still confused go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator and look at the past 7 trading days just trying to prevent yall from panicking so much
26,10,2021-02-03 01:45:45,you know what frustrates me the most about gme is that after a year of getting the crap beat out of us they cant even let us win just this once this year has sucked covid sky rocket unemployment people losing their homes people dying people having to choose between their health and putting food on the table a government not giving a shit about us and thinking 1800 bucks was enough to survive off of for 10 months then we get lucky and yes it was luck no one thought gme would break $100 and they even decided to take that from us if they had just let us cash in last week most likely everyone would have sold and gone home by friday the end but no they couldnt let us common people even have a crumb of the pie so that why im holding not bc i think ill make mass profits off my nine shares but bc after all the other bs i have had endure this year this is the end of my rope so fuck it im here to stay

5,5,2021-02-03 01:44:27,buy the dip but not yet hello to whoever reads this in the 5s before it gets deleted by mods heres an idea for all of you who are considering buying in or buying the dip does it not make sense that as long as trading restrictions are in place the price will continue to fall therefore if you were going to buy in would it not make more sense to wait for restrictions to be lifted especially given that the amount of available shares being traded right now is ridiculously low so if the shorts were to try and cover now they would still not be able to anyway im just a fellow retard so if someone would like to explain why im wrong about this please go ahead tldr if you have gme hold if youre planning to buy wait not financial advice not a professional etc etc

56,18,2021-02-03 05:24:25,this subreddit contains the majority of the board of directors with being high quantity shareholders of $gme yes we like the stock but this is also a side effect of having people like udeepfuckingvalues and upotato_in_my_ass who hold tens of thousands of shares $gme has to connect with all who own a large enough position within the company even if they bought the stock just because they like the stock that shows that the shareholders are more likely to want to help $gme to grow and grow the companys profits to those waiting on the gme board making some sort of statement this is likely why its not happened yet i am not a financial advisor just a recent college grad with two bachelors in business admin edit i remember upotato_in_my_ass being one of the big guys with dfv at the beginning i mayve wrote the username incorrectly it was mentioned in an article i read a week ago or so

12,14,2021-02-03 05:16:45,wsb potential for activism in gme as i write this gme is trading at $103sh with a $72b market cap im writing this to talk about gme objectively not that to the moon or 10k isnt a meme bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street im here to make money right now gme has $586m in cace $140m of which is restricted so really $446m to do whatever they want with their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 billion in goodwill over the last couple years right now the company has zero in goodwill basically saying its brand is worthless i disagree with this after the hype wsb has created for this company on the liability side as of q320 they have $224m and $216m in st and lt debt respectively for total debt of $450m gme please issue stock i know it will dilute the shit out of shs and drop the price but i think it would be a huge buying opportunity the fact that they havent already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent they couldve issued 45m shares when this thing was over $300 at $200250sh and brought in $1b cash but thats irrelevant now what they could do is still issue stock im not sure what price they could get for it but id be a buyer lets say they issue 5m shares at $100sh thats $500m cash $500m would be huge in transforming the business up that to 10m shares and they bring in $1b i think $1b is than $500m but im wetahded so i titled this wsb potential for activism in gme because collectively we own a shitload of shares could we not push for the company to issue stock here could we not send a letter to gme like hfs do but with they could use $250m to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation video gaming is a growth industry and yes brick and mortar is slowing dying but as dfv said in his original thesis thats a long way off gme needs to use the hype that wsb cultivated for its brand and capitalize on it the company couldnt have asked for a better xmas present than whats happening now people are buying fucking billboards for gme the company could be to gaming what chewy a $40b market cap is to the pet industry and clearly ryan cohen feels this way too gme needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and i really think raising funds now would accelerate this financials right now im estimating gme will make $5b in revenues in 2020 so were trading at 14x depressed revenues for comparison chwy trades at 6x revenue per yahoo finance this is a company that made $8b in 2018 and 2017 they recently reported holiday sales nov and dec of $17b down 19 yoy with 11 less stores open sss comps 48 yoy but heres the most positive digital sales were 309 yoy and $135b ytd as digital sales grow this should help alleviate sga expenses which have historically crushed profitability in 2017 2018 and 2019 sga was $2b and for 2020 its looking like itll be $1415b valuation this is a very basic backofenvelope calculation but if gme can return to $8b in revenues which is entirely possible and reasonable if they can execute and maintains historic gms of 30 we get $24b in gross profit and if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores they should be able to keep that sga expense under $2b lets say they can get it to $16b which is about $100150m above what sga will probably be this year accounting for store reopenings so $8b revenues 30 gm $24b gross profit $16b sga $800m in operating income assuming 30 tax rate $560m in net income if this plays out were currently trading at 129x $72b$560m what could be a reasonable net income in the next couple years my point is that gme might not be as overvalued as people think anyways please call me out on any bullshit in my thinkinglogic

158,28,2021-02-03 05:00:15,why we need a $gme flair repost wallstreetbets has become mostly $gme posts which is understandable because we are in a historical battle against hedge funds and every post can make a difference but wsb is not only about gme some people cant afford it and others dont want to invest in it anymore so i propose making a flair or filtering system for all new posts related to $gme to preserve the quality of this subreddit like it used to be in preww3 phase wsb is much more than $gme and no matter how it ends we still have other high quality posts buried underneath all of the $gme posts have people forgotten how we raised $amd and $tsla from the ashes to what they have become today and there are many other plays like that which we started right here bottom line is this community shouldnt be reduced to a gme only community because its much more than that edit some melvin type of bullshit is happening in here this post was previously banned the first time it was posted in addition some comments are being hidden by the mods now tell me whats the difference between us and them if we pull the same shit when we get the same power silencing me is against all what we are standing for
290,51,2021-02-03 04:56:56,ok listen up retards the market is fraudulent if youve seen the big short you know what i mean wall street the sec rating agencies the media and politicians all collude to maintain power for themselves while we are left to fight in the dark for scraps thats why gme and wsb scared them so much they are beginning to realize their grasp on power is slipping and are going to do it everything they can to take back control think back to the housing collapse and occupy wall street wall street broke the entire economy by offering as many loans as people would take it didnt matter if the person applying for their sixth housing loan was working part time at wendys with $100k in student debt they were making so much money they didnt care and the revolving door between wall street and the sec meant there was absolutely no accountability then comes occupy where idealist people came together and said enough you cant just destroy millions of families and then get bailed out for your trouble this scared the living shit out of the elites they saw that the veil was briefly lifted and everyday people that they treated like retarded filth could see the corruption and that the system was corroded from the inside out they knew that class warfare was coming and soon the plebs would kick out all of them from their ivory towers and rebuild the system to better suit the majority they couldnt allow this they needed to divide us so that we could be more easily controlled this is when identity politics and intersectionality began to be pushed in our society and culture instead of us being divided between common people and the elites who control our system we had to be divided based on race gender sexual orientation etc so that they could maintain power as we squabbled amongst ourselves left and right alike our politicians sold us out no matter what you think of trump he was a reaction to all of this not the cause although he did make the division much worse now once again the veil has been lifted we can see the blatant lies and misinformation pushed by the media to keep us at each others throats we can see janet yellen has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking on wall street that jen psakis brother is a portfolio manager at citadel that wall street will manipulate the markets right in front of our eyes and the sec wont lift a finger to do anything about it unless its to regulate us retail traders the system has been broken for a long time and now that everyday people can see the corruption they must stop us well fuck them they just stirred the hornets nest and we will fight back and we will win this is only the beginning tldr the system has been corrupt and broken for decades but now everyday people can see it clearly the elites in power are on borrowed time trcr

91,9,2021-02-03 04:42:01,short sale fails in a nutshell mm perspective saw a lengthy writeup about shady short failure coverage tactics so i wanted to update you guys on what that actually looks like in practice for a trader this is prefaced by the idea that traders hold stock proportionally against their positions to get delta neutral so they are not making directional bets on what stock does in situations like gme traders get extremely short stock through their positions as a result of trading the other side of what paper is doing as market makers they have short stock sale exemptions due to their status as a liquidity provider meaning they can sell stock short in all conditions to allow them to continue trading and providing liquidity in the options markets due to this they will often encounter a fail on their short stock position if the short float is big enough and it is difficult to acquire stock they are told by their clearing firm that they need to buy in a of their short position by the end of the day determined by the size of the fail a fail is considered a short term problem for these guys so this requires a short term solution in some cases the traders will get long stock through a conversion where they buy put sell call buy stock while this seems like a cop out there is an entire market around how they price revcons depending on the expiration of the options and the interest rates being charged the other main method to get long stock is to exercise your calls very often market makers will have large call positions as a result of natural trading and many of these calls can be in the money at the time of a fail due to how expensive it is to hold short stock against these very itm calls it can make sense to exercise these early as the savings from the short stock position outweigh the benefits of having the position open this is doubly true when youre using the exercise to cover a fail as you save money by exercising the calls early and prevent yourself from having to make a disadvantageous trade to cover additionally the market maker may try and prioritize trades in the open market that get them long stock but that is usually at the cost of putting on trades for bad prices this is probably the least favored option for that reason as it is a longterm solution that is often the least costeffective now this mainly applies to traders who are short stock as a hedge on their positions but hedge funds that are naked short likely use conversions to cover a fail as well as you can guess from the fact that youre using options to get synthetic short stock while buying long stock to cover your fail you will still be on the hook when those options expire additionally this costs money aint no freebies allowed in the trading world so whoever youre trading those conversions with is taking their pound of flesh while youre putting a bandaid on your other booboo if the stock remains very hardtoborrow and at a decent price level long term youll continue to make the firms eat shit on their short stock even if the price doesnt moon in the near future x200b tldr covering your fails short term with options still costs money if you keep holding they keep paying

622,66,2021-02-03 03:59:37,robinhood freezes stock as soon as short ladder attacks fail hey fellow diamond hands ive been following this group of autists for about three weeks now and i never expected all this craziness to happen when i joined on whim just to check it out now im in pretty deep and been following the story relentlessly robinhood replaced restrictions on the stock right as the short ladder attacks stopped they seem to only place restrictions on trade when it goes up never when it plummets theyre trying everything to freeze the price or lower it at any cost to stop its momentum robinhood restricting last thursday couldve been a fluke in market manipulation since they were completely broke and literally couldnt afford to buy anymore stock but this this is blatant market manipulation with no room for speculation they now have ample funding as seen in their stupid ass tweets and the correlation between nyse stopping short ladder attacks and them placing a max cap on how many gme stocks can possibly buy is just too much theyre doing everything in their power to stop this stock and its actually scaring me a little if they can pull this illegal crap with no punishment ive completely lost faith in our free market ive already filed a complaint to the sec about this issue and i hope you guys do the same this war is far from over edit i know that exchanges freeze stocks not brokers robinhood is contributing to the price stagnation right now a price freeze in my mind by putting restrictions on how much you can buy yet again

27,9,2021-02-03 03:41:38,my theory on last thursday and how i believe rh failed its users quick disclaimer i have no concrete info to back this up just a series of questions i want rh and citadel to answer i do not believe citadel ever told rh to stop trading that would be so flagrantly illegal that if anything ever came out about it people would actually go to jail these people are smart enough to know how to skirt the law so something like that never even comes into play i also dont believe they ever had to tell rh to do anything because they were well aware what to expect what do we know about rh and citadel citadel buys more information from rh than any other customer theyre also an investor im not sure exactly what data they purchaseare privy to but i cannot imagine it does not include a potential liquidity crisis should certain events in the market take place remember how udeepfuckingvalue was telling us to be aware of increased short activity back in early december as it would be an attempt to drive the share price down are we supposed to believe that some of the most sophisticated financial institutions on earth did not notice something and start making contingency plans heres what i want to know from robinhood preferably in a situation where theyre under oath 1 at what point were they aware of a potential liquidity crisis 2 what steps did they take to increase deposits on hand once they started to see user movement towards heavily shorted stocks on their platform 3 who is in charge of their risk management strategy where was this person during the past few months and finally the most important question 4 at what point was citadel informed that robinhood might be required to limit buys of gme due to liquidity requirements if events unfolded a certain way tldr i dont think citadel ever had to tell rh to do anything because they already knew what was coming
45,81,2021-02-03 03:37:29,understanding short interest the most important post you will downvote all day  shortinterest ratio is the number of shares sold short short interest divided by average daily volume this is often called the daystocover ratio because it determines based on the stocks average trading volume how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions if the price goes up eili5 a stock has a short interest of 4 shares average daily volume of shares traded is 20 204 5 this would mean 5 days to cover x200b what is short selling x200b short selling is the opposite of buying stocks its the selling of a security that the seller does not own done in the hope that the price will fall you can borrow the stock from your brokerdealer sell it and get the proceeds from the sale if the stock price declines you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock you realize a gain bingo what was the price of $gme last week it was over $200 over $300 over $400 evenwhat is the price of $gme now $117 and as low as $74 if i opened a short position at $300 and closed it out at $7422 the very bottom of the daymaybe the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a profitand sold to all of you who thought you were buying the dip based on reddit logic its impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200 of course they did that is an absolutely ridiculous price everyone knows what happens after a short squeezelook at the vw chart its easy to understand that a $300 price of gme wouldnt last that long so if you short it at $300why would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop more it drops more you make you all keep going back to the thought that melvin who shorted at 4 5 10 dollars a sharehas not covered what do you think happened when the stock went up 400 last week

38,24,2021-02-03 03:26:28,icln whats behind the $10m options play i bought to open 611 jan 23 call options on icln at $45 today at $57 at a cost of around $350k this was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19261 contracts bought since friday ishares global clean energy etf is the largest clean energy etf and has the most liquid options market of any of the esg funds jan 2023 began trading last monday and july 2021 and jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available $45 in recent days why imo these options are hella cheap with iv around 50 on an etf that has quadrupled from low of $8 in past year with top holding plug up 1800 in past year if icln only doubles to $60 in next year and iv reverts to historical mean of 80 $58 options 45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry and this $10m is really nothing compared to trillions in capital already deployed by the us china and europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy the us joined this wave with bidens plan trillions in direct subsidies in conjunction with trillions in quantitative easing by the fed and other central banks as just one example plug has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants 2 operational next year so in summary while the focus has been on gme etc in recent days over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing trillions in stimulus trillions in cheap money could make for very nice returns
403,68,2021-02-03 03:11:33,its time to fight in the mud cant you autists see the game has changed hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest it is not here is why a short squeeze results from a low availability of shares the price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze hedge funds need a lot of shares and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money they do however have a lot of money hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged but the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares once the amount of free floating shares is too low hedge funds panic much like the vw short squeeze for the price of one share on friday $330 you could have purchased 4 shares today $82 hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money but we can fight back when they are cheap furthermore allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further let them drive the price down let them trigger that rule and then load up slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds and they will have no choice but to cover that is when you get to name your price everything in between is just for show i am not a financial advisor nor a professional by any means all information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical i am retarded i own gme shares start fighting hedge funds with their own tactics its time to fight in the mud

97,22,2021-02-03 03:03:27,theory the drop yesterday was in part due to institutional monthly rebalancing can anyone share their thoughts on the effects of institutional rebalancing with the 20x rise in gme in late jan wouldnt funds need to sell off gme in order to bring their weighting back down i see 3 major players the holders the shorters and the investment funds wsb isnt selling maybe even buying the dip the shorters eventually need to cover and will be buying so where is all this sell pressure coming from could it be from institutional rebalancing looking at whale wisdom and sort by of portfolio that percentage shot up for all these funds by 131 and they all hold tens of thousands of shares would these funds be forced to sell off large chunks of shares to bring their of portfolio back in line with what it was on 1231
197,42,2021-02-03 02:59:05,rh changes gme restriction to 100 stocks but you should move away from rh now  x200b guy claims that gme is bouncing back due to robinhood lifting the gme restriction stock started bouncing back at 1050 am anyone still using rh can confirm that robinhood lifted the restriction around that period if so that definitely confirmed the hypothesis gme is down due to low rh demandamongst other reasons such as short ladder attack if you have cash in rh you need to move all your money into another brokerage now there is no guarantee that rh wouldnt pull some bs tactics again in the near future x200b edit got 2 confirms in the comments 
366,30,2021-02-03 02:54:12,yall brought meaning to my life again obviously longtime lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity ive truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first i came for the memes guilty but stayed for the community as with most of the world and especially the us life has been pretty challenging over the last year for me thats meant an anxiety and depression cocktail which not even my wifes boyfriend could help me get out of i stopped caring for myself and caring about anything really and although i keep trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this that changed two weeks ago when my friend and i decided to go in on gme and just see what happens i went from checking this sub a few times a week to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement banding together and support i have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks have been amazing it jolted me back into caring at least a little bit about myself and life it didnt solve the challenges i face but i feel more alive than i have in over a year and it has helped me see i can get out of the dark place i was in with some help and putting in a little effort each day to change my behaviors i appreciate all of you not you paper hands though and please drink water exercise try and eat healthy and take time to disconnect once and a while care for the people in your life and any strangers who are not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders gme97 gme325 gme269 game180 amc16 this is not financial advice and is for entertainment only i cannot read do not take advice from me i am not smart i just like the stock edit spelling for weeks or months if i have to i aint leaving
138,39,2021-02-03 02:53:34,gme valuation this is not financial advice maybe we need to change some laws if we have to always write these disclosures im a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because i was tired of the manipulation by large institutions the game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play what is gme worth for all of you that like the stock i think what you are saying is that you like video games and the culture around gaming and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas i can fully get behind that and i can hope the gme management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming at some point though the price of gme stopped being about gme fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze a very valid reason to buy the stock watching this all play out i noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company when the shorts stopped covering it wasnt because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet but it was because they had already lost the legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt it did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didnt matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300 it is not more bankrupt at $400 you can be right about bankrupting some wall street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back my theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasnt worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 these numbers are theoretical bankruptcy payouts take a long time and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money well that can take years not ideal for portfolio returns summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite there is an upper bound on the short squeeze price also and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better wall street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities and unwinding risk off of the other entities if you are bankrupt you dont borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out and if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars because no one can save him anyway and giving you that money so you can get out debt i bought some gme this morning because it felt like a good gamble and my guess is that there are still some shorts value in the short entities
105,24,2021-02-03 02:34:07,gme and a rigged horse race your friend just got the hot tip on a race horse who is a sure thing and you think fuck it why not the bookie you use takes your bet and prices the horse 251 the horse wins the race by 75 lengths and youre convinced its worth betting again the next race the horse comes back and for some reason the bookie didnt even bother to price the odds correctly and prices the horses odds at 201 you take your winnings from last week and pile it all on your favourite horse to win again this cycle continues for a few weeks until youve taken your initial sum of money and cleared out the bookie for hundreds of thousands millions perhaps this weeks race comes up and the bookie realised how much money youve made from this one horse and decides he doesnt want to live with that kind of a loss to his balance sheet you place your bet with all of your winnings for this weeks race and again the horses odds stay the same the bookie then makes a trip to the racecourse where your horse is pauses the race and starts to smack your horse with a baseball bat to its legs for a while and then finally lets the race proceed you lose your bet all your winnings and the bookie is back to where he started because he couldnt face having to lose all his money if this was a true story the bookie and whoever helped him set this whole incident up would be sent to jail for defrauding the gambling industry and fixing the outcome of a race whats so different about what happened to gme and what this story described
427,56,2021-02-03 02:33:11,likely revenge on broker hawks good news you guys and gals will be delighted to hear about this the joseph saveri law firm is litigating a class action law suit against 35 defendants including robinhood melvin capital citadel etc link in case you zoomers boomers and everyone in between have never heard of them js is literally one of the worlds best and most successful firms for antitrust litigation read the article if youre still mad at all these brokers for limiting our ability to buy because frankly if anyone can win this lawsuit it would be the joseph saveri law firm now i got this news from a lawyer myself so im not exactly sure about this but at the end of the article it states plaintiffs seek to recover damages as well as injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the proposed class from the defendants based on lines near the beginning i assume this class is any retail investor invested in any of the 12 companies yes 12 stocks mentioned if so wouldnt this mean we would all be entitled to compensation i hope so until then hold and buy the dip that is the sole opinion of the writer and not financial advice good luck and godspeed to all our gme brethren around the world

146,25,2021-02-03 02:24:31,bullish signs on a seemingly tragic day were still in the game price action dd edit forgot to add gme in the title this is for the gme boyz just like last week we are under a lowvolume short ladder and just like last week bulls are hindered by brokerages restrictions however a remarkable thing happened today gme tested a previous athresistance $7676 gme first pulled back from that price point on jan 21st when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s it was the first day ever trading was halted intraday and our first massive win against hedge funds $7676 slapped us in the face and called us his bitch so why is todays price action bullish because when a stock tests previous aths and it bounces off of them thus turning a resistance into a support its a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run pltr did that nio did that too in the past they went sky high not as gme duh tested previous aths then kept flying to their own moon trips now look at gme recovery and imagine how high its going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions yes gme could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $7676 resistance now turned into support guys i dont have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion i am blessed i can buy gme on my broker looking forward for an amazing run through q4 to gme newbies this has always been a q4 play i was expecting the squeeze to happen after q4 er revealed what a powerhouse gme is and i still do accumulate hold squeeze cheer disclaimer not financial advice first bought gme in october paper handed in late january back in the game after seeing todays price action
243,20,2021-02-03 02:23:37,mackenzie bezos has better than you autists mackenzie bezos was able to her investment for 26 years you autists are complaining after being down 30 after one week bezos wife understood the value in holding the dip and held her position through the dotcom crash so she could cash out in 2019 for $38 billion her position was in the red for 10 years before amazon finally recovered and you autists cant even hold through two red days if mackenzie can hold for 26 years you autists can hold gme for more than 2 weeks tldr and one day you might become a billionare from amazon disclaimer this post is satire and not financial advice sec fuck off and start investigating the short sellers
113,37,2021-02-03 02:22:45,gme is severely undervalued ryan cohen and his chewy team he brought in are worth atleast $1012 billion alone see chewy at $42 billion not to mention gamestops state if the art game trade in and game buy back system which is probably worth another $5080 billion by itself put all of that together and just right there gme should be valued between $6090 billion not even to mention their real estate locations right now gme market cap is only $7 billion so really we should be sitting atleast 85x higher than we are now not even counting the squeeze strap in boy and girls and hold on
158,23,2021-02-03 02:22:06,start playing towards your strengths and stop acting invincible much like gamestop wsb must return to their core competencies to succeed listen up retards and most importantly new members it is important that you actually read this post and others i know its a joke around here too many words cant read i get it information is a valuable weapon stop voluntarily ignoring it i am not a financial advisor i just like the stock and that is why i am going to provide some insight into how gme arrived to the position they are in and how wsb arrived to the position we are in now gamestop backstory i will briefly cover the backstory of gamestop but for more accurate information and in depth discussion i recommend you listen to rod alzmanns gme dd as a guest on the modern guilt podcast found on spotify essentially gamestop began to slip as ecommerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now as a result earlier management tried to pivot away from gamestops core competencies large user base and tradeinsecond hand sales which pushed it further into misfortune eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely wsb backstory leading up to the now viral gme bonanza this sub and the strategies used were much different gme started off as a value play although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play the following was small at first but grew as gmes potential grew the core competencies of the following consisted of excellent dd knowledgeable users willing to share research and less knowledgeable users willing to learn i no longer feel as though this is the core competency of gme gang the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction that is not a bad thing and i will get to that later once the gme squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by gme gang the original competencies actually flourished users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze the prevailing strategy was to buy shares only never use margin or over leverage yourself and not to purchase options those competencies were what made wsb unstoppable in the begging and they were based on pure reason alone buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on hfs avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room these strategies worked and you can check the first week and a half of the gme movement to confirm that it was rock solid but then something happened people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly it resulted in all calls ending itm on the friday before last week it produced a gamma squeeze but that tactic is short lived the mms quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium the options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin i understand the allure of options but just consider the amount of money that vanished last friday calculate the cost of all of those options from $330$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted yes it was stolen form you it wouldnt have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking gme buys but it is time to adapt and overcome return to your core competencies and improve upon them stop ignoring thorough dd and stop neglecting to do your own do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny return to the original thesis improve the core competencies we are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid if you read anything in this post it should be this the stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear the squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds hedge funds have an abundance of money but they lack the volume to close their positions individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against hfs think about this hfs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding when the price is low retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares the price being low puts hfs in a bad position at low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares further increasing the scarcity for those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250 $300 $400 etc i salute you but i dont encourage this behavior buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns let them trigger the short sell rule let them give you a discount a squeeze can start at $1 or $1000 it doesnt matter and the base cost of the stock equally doesnt matter in an infinity squeeze return to your core competencies allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price buy when the price is cheap allow it to inflate naturally and wait for it fall again before loading up more once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds there are three ways to win a positive catalyst natural price growth or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death options are no longer effective consolidate your efforts do your part to spread and scrutinize important information stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you if youre still on robinhood set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately if youre still on margin take it off if youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them get extended hours trading get off toxic brokerage platforms return to your core competencies and stop running in circles i am not a financial advisor nothing in this post should be used as investment advice this is my take on a purely speculative situation and i recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade i like the stock and own gme shares tldr for starters stop slacking off and actually read dd posts information is essential in warfare stop buying options they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by mms and now works against us return to the strategy that got us to this point the price dropping allows retail investors to maximize the effectiveness of the only weapon they truly have against hfs its time to fight in the mud
179,122,2021-02-03 02:21:02,why are you guys still using robinhood robinhood fucked you guys over so hard and yet i see dozens of posts of rh screenshots every hour fucking get off of rh and move to another brokerage stop posting screenshots of rh youre just supporting the company that fucked you each time you post a screenshot of yourself using rh dont talk about diamond hands and how rh is manipulative and tanked gme when you still use rh practice what you preach and gtfo robinhood x200b stop screenshotting from robinhood
273,60,2021-02-03 02:01:56,why is the stock plummeting so much mark cuban will tell you why question asked by upinklips_indy answered by umcuban supply and demand but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled when rh shut it down then cut it back lets put aside why they cut of the greatest source of demand they created a robinhood dive no rh buyers means sellers lower their price to find buyers and they keep on lowering it till they find buyers keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on falling then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls when that margin call happens its brutal they just take your stock send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price no matter how low they just want to get your cash to pay back the loan that then accelerates the selling which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with gme in particular so what to do if you can afford to hold the stock you hold i dont own it but thats what i would do why because when rh and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers then we will see what wsb is really made of that is when you get to make it all work i have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on wsb i know you are going to hate to hear this but the lower it goes the more powerful wsb can be stepping up to buy the stock again the only question is what broker do you use do you stay with rh who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again or do you as a group find a broker with a far far far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on wall street x200b personal position 11 shares $245

506,41,2021-02-03 01:52:11,theyre dumping shares onto the market continue to hold while looking at the bids and asks on gamestop i noticed that at the start a lot of asks with a lot of shares were placed those are probably by institutional investors my theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting just look at this bid with 30k shares x200b a lot of asks with a relatively big volume at once the good news is that it seems like they cant keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock and because most retail investors already bought gme it seems like the demand is going down x200b here you can clearly see that the volume of stocks being dumped on the market is going down so what does that mean for us as long as were not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down but that doesnt matter as long as we keep holding with our fucking diamond hands i see you on the moon retards edit this is not financial advice i just really like this stock

104,35,2021-02-03 01:49:15,psa bb is sexy i love you gme gang but the real story today is that bb is trading at an amazing discount its caught in the gme crossfire and creates an amazing value opportunity go look at the good dds that were initially posted and keep in mind they have a 50 market share in their industry uem for corporations and govs os for vehicules and communication encryption for multiple clients bb is everywhere around you and you dont necessarily realize it could it go back down to $8 with all the bullshit going down sure it could can it go back up to $30 by eoy conservatively yes they are working hard to change perceptions and even without the initial hype $2030 usd is a very conservative valuation for bb when you look at comparables and at their financials not everything is a squeeze and remember that gme started as a value play more than a year ago disclosure i just passed an order to add 125 shares on top of my 4 leap contracts
0,39,2021-02-03 15:31:12,hey gmetards sometimes we just make a bad call ball up admit it and get to recovering tldr read the fucking post this is more therapeutic for my own disappointment than it is me trying to teach you guys the most important lesson i fucked up today and it cost me $7k that i will most likely be realizing all or most tomorrow i set a long term pt on gme of $4060 because i want to see a $10bn gamestop in the next year or so and instead i got excited and emotional and jumped in around the $129 mark this afternoon thinking the sqozening heres my screwup because i got emotional and didnt wait patiently to see if the upward trend this afternoon had firm footing spoiler alert it did not i was only up by about $2k when the floor fell out from under me i am extremely lucky because ive been trading all the way up and managed to sell quite a lot of $19dca shares at $380 and throw those profits into my savings account but i left $25k about 25 of my gains in my investment account to play around with my cpa said not to and i thought i could outsmart him ideally tomorrow wont be straight red and i can escape with $17k or more hopefully but this should teach you that sometimes you make a shit trade thats why youre supposed to play with money that you can unemotionally lose seriously guys its giving me secondhand panic to see the guys who threw their savings in at $300 and watching the value sink very steadily down to $80 and possibly less and then they justify it with buuuuut its to show the 1 how powerful i am theyre still billionaires and youre getting evicted you really showed them going forward ill write this $7k against my gains and maybe toss the remaining $17k into the spy or something boomerish while i wait to file my taxes next year or ill drop the position to 100 shares realizing about $3000 in losses and sell weekly covered calls to hopefully chase the decreasing share price until i feel comfortable holding very long term or get assigned above my dca inb4 melvin bot
811,94,2021-02-03 11:18:39,financial advice for people who just joined wsb from a degenerate veteran tldr only invest with wsb what youre willing to lose recently theres been a huge influx of people who joined wsb in hopes of making millions of dollars and buying lamborghinis im here to give you some boring ass boomer advice wsb is less of an investing subreddit and more of a gambling one sir this is a casino i mean its in the name right wallstreet bets over the last few years that ive been a member ive seen a lot of people yolo their life savings on spy calls and puts and lose bigly these people are wsb legends but are also actual retards however id say that a significant percentage of us are smart investors by that i mean that we are financially responsible enough to know not to put all of our life savings into gourds i dont have a financial background so take what i say with a grain of salt but ive been a member of personalfinance and financialindependence subreddits for a while before joining wsb im not asking you to be a degenerate autist and put your money on boomer ass dividend stocks and jerk off over making $2 on dividends a year but to be a little bit more responsible with your money by that i mean the following if you have student loans try paying back your student loans asap since those will fuck with you the most if you are broke ass shit and jacked to tits in 200k loans the last thing you want to do is to take out more loans to gamble on memestonks see what your minimum payments are and try to hit those and if you have money leftover you can use that to fuck around with save 3 months of rent and food depending on where you live id say about $3000 in an emergency savings account or some boomer lowrisk etf like voo do this because if you lose all your money where the fuck are you going to stay and eat before throwing all your money in robinhood put some in your roth ira since the taxman wont take away a lot of your gains if you do make hella gains on some yolo option on robinhood save like 20 or whatever that shortterm capital gain amount is for the taxman or hell come back to bite you in the ass once you have some emergency cash stored or are willing to live with your parents and have made some minimal contributions to your roth ira arent swimming in credit card and student loans and can make your minimum payments you are now ready to be a wsb degenerate this isnt an investing subreddit a lot of us play with money which we are okay with losing although ive made a lot more on rh than i have on the measly 10 yearly gains with my roth ira and 401k its nice to see that on red days when the market is drilling into the earths asshole and all my weeklies will expire worthless i still havent lost as much in my other boomer accounts once you feel like youre in a comfortable enough place in life where your only source of income is not your weekly spy calls you are now ready to be a wsb degenerate like us start off testing the waters by buying a few shares of some of the most mentioned tickers here without doing any dd since we cant read and lose some money on shitty stocks $pltr and $mt edit relax fellow palantards this is a joke i too am a bagholder believer once you feel like you understand the little intricacies of the market bad earnings stonk fall good earnings stonks go up but maybe could go down also biden president meaning weed and clean energy go up you can now invest invest in options optional buy a cheap $01 option that is way over the money to understand how options work what theta decay is etc i like to think of rh as playing roulette where i just toss a bunch of $$ on hype stocks and hope for the best but you could also make some safe bets depending on your risk tolerance and actually try to do some dd yourself but we dont do that here in the late 2020 tech crash i lost over $5000 on dumb ass tech calls but it didnt really affect me that much since it was my play money and you win some you lose some if that money actually meant a lot to me id have been super fucked so yeah if you were to get one thing out of this post only invest with wsb what youre willing to lose heres some other lessons ive learned over the years dont give stock tips to anyone especially family learned that the hard way read my previous post if youre going full retard and investing in penny stocks stoploss is your friend having said that welcome to wsb positions 100 gme $1180 on october 12 and still holding

31,23,2021-02-03 07:46:33,regarding the short selling restriction for gme i have seen many people in the comments saying that as of tomorrow there wont be any short selling allowed for gme this image was shared of a spreadsheet released by the nyse however if you look at the image it says the trigger date is 21 and the proposed deactivation date is 23 doesnt that mean the restriction started yesterday and will actually end today is there another meaning for trigger date and deactivation date if someone could clarify what these two mean that would be helpful also mandatory disclaimer that im a retard this is not financial advice blah blah blah apes strong
143,27,2021-02-03 07:42:24,gme and amc apes  hey guys first of all i know the morale is low today because of the big attack on gme from the hedgefucks and their boyfriends we need to hold strong nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week the media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting we were 2 million last week now we are 8 million we have grown in numbers and im sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people but i am certain that we will prevail we need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by friday the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover it is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130 short interest to just 30 thats fucking impossible 1 up until friday the short interest had rather increased 2 i know for sure they didnt fucking trade over the weekend 3 retail investors we are holding a big chunk of those stocks wake up they are trying to make us surrender it is impossible that they have covered their positions between friday and today lets hold the line lets get it back to $200$300 levels we might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up do not let those bastards win we must remain strong and united the whole world is watching us this is our legacy we are being part of the history of investing and finance we can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won we owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits lets go hold strong diamond hands 
202,57,2021-02-03 07:40:58,got a mega good feeling about tomorrow the return of gme yes today has been rough yes a lot of peoples are down but this is the moment in any story which defines who wins we need to rally together go back to how this started a sole focus on one stock fucking by wall stress i fully believe we rally together and refuel gme to the moooon 
53,8,2021-02-03 07:40:13,imagine if all the retards in the sub could move as one massive retard like the hedge funds were up against if we could all piggy back udeepfuckingvalue straight into valhalla  crossposts arent allowed but you retards need to hear this how a dao could take the gme case to a different level while it may rather seem to be a post for rethtrader this is a post in which i try to make the case for how a dao could supercharge what rwallstreetbets did with gme a collaborative attack on a billion dollar hedgefund i didnt know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the gamestop stock and as many people i had to read into what was actually happening skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple reddit rascals tricking wallstreet suits however if you follow the topic closely on reddit you can clearly see that for some people including udeepfuckingvalue i highly recommend to check out this post on rvideo featuring his original analysis this was neither a getrichquick scheme nor some joke people really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls i personally dont think that this sentiment will eventually last although i hope to be proved wrong there may be even more people on the subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands however overall there is a lack of proof that people did hold contributing to an increasing lack of trust because people dont know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing people lose the ability to act as a collective now dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies a dao that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners dilemma that gme stock holders currently experience this provides retail users with unprecedented powers of course joining forces is possible for everyone retail users and bankers but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful at least relatively the people who would join forces by adding funds to a dao gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily this makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments shortterm people with a political agenda flip the bird to wallstreet wont see this as a problem what would be needed is a dao with a bridge to the stock market not as easy but still possible in the very near future i am halfsure we might see this of solution within the next year
1,1,2021-02-03 06:32:13,know thy self know thy enemy a thousand battles a thousand victories sun tzu a thesis on gme in order to adhere to wsb rules this post is strictly for discussion purposes and not to instigate or coordinate any market activity 1 wall street as we have seen the past two days wall street has certainly created a plan of action to fuck us over and drive the price down and cover their shorts in an elongated time span which minimizes their losses even though they pay more interest over time it will cost less to cover if they slowly cover while driving the price down $200 due to low volume after the first squeeze at this rate wall street may very well have this squeeze under some control and may be able to cover their positions without total market catastrophe this thesis is under the assumption that s3s data was somewhat accurate 30m shares short currently and that the 122 short interest from the end of last week is mistaken as the 122 short interest from jan 15 68m shares short according to shortsqueezecom this information is crucial as it would mean this thesis is the only way to hypothetically guarantee another squeeze no matter what because simply holding at 30m shares short very well may leave us as the bag holders downvote me idc someone needs to validly bring up the elephant in the room before this echo chamber turns even more batshit than qanon 2 supply and demand thank you to mark cuban for the ama this morning as he gave me more insight on how this thesis could work the price of the stock is determined by supply and demand given that demand has dropped since friday so has the stock price this sub has gone full retard trying to drive up demand this week and it has had little effect on wall streets plan the other half of the equation is supply we have tried limiting supply in one aspect by buying up shares at these high prices but we havent effectively been limiting supply in the most efficient way all of the og gme retards loaded up on otm longdated calls back in 2020 and those are now all deep itm hypothetically exercising them would decrease the supply of shares in a more cost effective manor than simply buying and holding and raise the market value based on supplydemand right what do i know tho i barely passed intro to econ 3 the unplanned thesis we have seen a lot of referencing of the 2008 volkswagen squeeze and how theres a dip right before the rip this does not correlate with our current dip as that week was a brutal week in the market in general what did cause the squeeze was porsche announcing its raise in the companies stake reducing supply the squeeze occurred purely off of supply and demand we all saw what happened today when gme dipped hard into the 70s the volume was there and the demand was high enough to throw the shorts off of their plan this forced the hour long spike from people buying and shorts covering eventually leading shorts to gain control again and rebalance their shitshow situation i have noticed the unprecedented following that dfv has accumulated in the past few months and right now he is essentially tarzan with the amount of smooth brain monkeys he has surrounding him if dfv were to hypothetically informe his beloved followers on his daily yolo update that he was exercising his april 12c at the next days dip then the if hes holding im holding crowd may turn into the if hes holding and exercising im holding and exercising right monke see monke do this section is not meant to incite market manipulation as i am purely speculative and opening discussion on the psychological effects and market impact this thesis may have if itm call holders coincidentally exercised at the same moment intraday when volume and demand are high would a massive squeeze occur where shorts cant get back into their dipcover daily cycle and are forced to cover it all in a day i hope the best for us all and the worst for wall street positions gme 800c 219 tldr if supply were dramatically decreased at a point of high volume demand before lunchtime from a bunch of itm calls being exercised then gme would squeeze like we all dreamed of for legal reasons this post is strictly theoretical discussion and i do not condone market manipulation before anyone says anything im a first time poster whos been autistic since birth and joined you retards in april
3245,369,2021-02-03 13:46:13,dont forget to leave this sub after you post your loss porn new gme people i have been here several years long enough to remember a man crying in wolf mask as his paper apple gains disappeared on a live stream and this gme run was crazy entertaining i did not partake but watching this on the news and seeing the subreddit logo was great however its reached the point where its ruining this sub jeff bezos stepped down and amazon and google reported earnings which used to be big days on this sub but i see nothing but a sea of gme thanks for checking out this subreddit but when this gme run ends please post your loss porn so i can beat off and then leave this subreddit also the guy who lost 765k today your loss porn was great you can stay thats the yolos this sub was built on not one share of gme bets
477,167,2021-02-03 13:26:07,why it might not be best to buy the dips for gme right now we are in trench warfare the shorts and wsb with some whales and institutional supports are fighting neck and neck but why the shorts want to bankrupt gme we know that wont happen because this company has ryan cohen as ceo the shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can but we keep buying the dips if im honest the shorts are winning right now but the short interest is still high so they have to cover we are spending our capital buying the dips when we should hold our shares now let the price tank then buy up even more shares would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day day after day or do you want to let them win let the price tank then buy up even more shares before they can cover spending 240 on 3 shares or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece while eating up the available shares i know which one sounds better to me the shorts plan theres a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply then they will buy far otm calls and trigger the squeeze themselves then once at the top theyll buy puts and tank the price again this allows them to cover make money on the upswing make money on the downswing possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base tldr let the shorts drive the price down dont buy the dip just hold your shares you have now and with your remaining capital watch the price tank then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip play into their hand and let them think theyve won and that we gave up then thats when shares become available for people to snatch up cheaply

96,40,2021-02-03 12:57:26,grounded uncertainty current position 160 $gme $10532 avg 2x $gme 300c 219 1x gme 800c 212 hows it going apes ive been lurking since the covid market crash and have recently been seeing a lot of sensible posts that make it seem like the squeeze has squozen and all of the shorts have been covered maybe the media wasnt lying maybe the posts are getting into the one wrinkle my smooth brain has left well see im just posting to see if anyone can reference me to evidence or good dd that can refute some of these ideas but some of the things arent adding up first things first this sub has gotten pretty hive mindy a lot of the dd posted is grounded in speculation or the idea that everyone is out to get us and no one is on our side its naive but lets assume no one was lying and that the media isnt out to get us theyre just lazy and writing easy articles with little to no research for those yummy clicks lets kick this off 1 the hedgies covered their short positions around the height of the squeeze the media was claiming that the hedge funds have closed out their short positions this was refuted by the fact that short interest hadnt decreased but potentially increased this comment poses a really good argument as to why this is possible basically its saying that the jump to 500 was the squeeze and they reopened shorts at a better position that was us winning the hedge funds cut their losses we interpreted that as them doubling down now were the bagholders and this war of attrition will be us slowly selling our shares as more and more of us realize that the game is over 2 volume no one is selling look at the volume spike and the price spike this morning the price spike this morning was the gamma squeeze the seller of the contract has t2 days to deliver the shares they obviously waited for the share price to be as low as possible because they knew the squeeze was over were against people who have much more money and education in this field why would they not try to maximize their profits as well i dont think holding does anything but decrease liquidity the people buying isnt them its us 3 dfv didnt sell mark cuban said to hold i havent actually dug through post comment history so correct me if i am wrong but i think dfv is in it for the long haul he genuinely likes the stock i dont think his plan was to make a quick buck off of a squeeze and mark cuban said to hold if you believed in the company he said not to sell if your reason for buying hasnt changed well if the squeeze squoze would that not be the reason changing i didnt see him reference the squeeze itself and whether or not we were winning rather we did the right thing x200b i hate to be a debbie downer but i dont drink and i am sober enough to see the partys over we won kind of im still balls deep diamond handing on a wish that gme takes off to the moon i just need some reassurance because all the dd in the past couple days hasnt been grounded enough to convince me that were still in for a ride whatever happens were in this together im not fuckin selling yet

1860,333,2021-02-03 12:53:46,final boss fight its happening tomorrow with yellen sec and federal reserve emeegency meeting to talk about gme volatility guys its happening they know they are screwed yellen is having an emergency meeting tomorrow or the day after with the sec heads federal reserve federal bank bank of new york and the cftc and the meeting is about gamestop volatility x200b what volatility im sure youre asking the one coming from the squeeze they are mega fucked today only around 15 of float gme remains there is sufficient real research on this sub that shows that we are actually diamond handing that 15 will get gobbled up in no time with our retarded gme buying see locked in shares top left retards x200b on another note some peoples sell limit at 32k and 5k got filled today for 1 single gme share on this sub x200b thesis goldman sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in gme and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well i cant tell if this is fud or if they truly believe this this info is in their daily customer subscription mailers only actual gs customers get these mailers afaik i dont know what is the truth anymore if yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 984 ish locked in by buyers this screams all kinds of alarms in my head they are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time tomorrow is the final fight yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before friday due to the naked short puts the hfts have been selling that are likely 205 of expiry they do not want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up they also dont want the squeeze to happen on friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 205 puts if all that makes sense this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and not next week or this friday x200b if none of this happens cohen still has this smoking gun to trigger it x200b final words set your sell limits set your sell limits yes you for the next 2 days straight theres some consensus on the sub that realistically it should be 800 add a few lottos at 5k and 10k too as some people were lucky to get filled on 32k and 5k today dont get too greedy or you might not fill good luck retards
215,31,2021-02-03 12:50:40,alrite you lennys lets talk nonsquoze dd for everyone stuck holding a $400 share and wondering where this goes from here why arent you cost averaging down lets look at gamestops current metrics gamestops current market cap at $90 is $65bil on last earnings gme reported $1bil in revenue with $18mil in net income they made $1000000000 in revenue in 3 months and they need to save $18000000 per quarter to turn a profit any improvements they make to the operations is going to keep pushing them farther into the green they couldnt do much worse than last year with the pandemic but instead they are about to have their largest quarter in recent history hear me out between the dualrelease of the ps5 and the xbox console sales will be a huge boost but that is expected the other new market that no one is discussing is trading cards pokemon and magic tcg both had a huge year with card shops being shut down a very large amount of sales went through gamestop because scalpers were clearing out big box retailers and gamestop takes preorders for them my local gamestop put a limit on 20 preorders per person so that they could try to guarantee allocation 20 per customer and they had to limit it gamestop has extra cash in the bank from the preorders for the next shiny vault pokemon set coming out so they actually have cash on the books in advance for this upcoming earnings report youre going to see a huge surprise their new partial owner ryan cohen took chewy up against amazon and won and he brought his best team with him to gamestop gamestop did 35 of their revenue through online sales in october wait until rc streamlines it and builds a market around the brand name recognition so ask yourself does a $6bil cap company with $1bil in quarterly revenue quarterly on the cusp of turning a profit and with the best online sales team in the market sound like a decent investment to you because that is what gamestop at $90 is hold on my fellow lennys the long term looks good from here $100 is going to be a floor soon skys the ceiling even without a squeeze 
134,19,2021-02-03 12:48:50,federal law requires reporting of short positions so this is something i just found out about and i thought everyone else might be interested as well remember how its a giant mystery as to who has had a short position on gme and we were just going off a rumor mill for months that it was melivin well until melvin publicly reported almost going out of business so it turns out since 2010 when the doddfrank act was signed into law investing managers have been required to to disclose short positions just like they do their longs the sec just chooses not to implement this considering naked short attacks are what took down the banks in 08 turning that mess into a crisis its crazy the sec doesnt have to respect federal law the law itself is giant but theres also a bunch of public comments on the sec site encouraging them to actually do their job if anyone is interested in suggesting they actually implement 929x from the doddfrank act theres a page on sending in public comments 
40,32,2021-02-03 12:41:57,so in order to have gme buy restrictions lifted if we forget the conspiracies and follow their rules the daily fund requirements brokers have to deposit with their clearing houses increased because gme was too volatile and because there were way more buys than sells at popular brokers does it mean that if hypothetically buyers spread their buys on multiple daysweeks in order to lower volatility move some of the gme stocks they already have from the most popular brokers to other less exposed brokers in order to lower the quantity of gme held by the more popular brokers and also to make room for newer investors who tend to use popular platforms then brokers would be in the clear and could lift restrictions is that right hypothetically feasible

3680,330,2021-02-03 11:30:39,you guys are paper handing $gme because you havent seen the squoze yet and are worried the company is worth nothing  most of you retards in gme got in when the stock already jumped several times from where it was 8 weeks ago youre all shouting wall st is preventing the moass through manipulative actions they definitely are however youre all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process we didnt invest in gme because the shorts were over 140 of the float and wanted to punish wall st if any of you autists actually did some dd or even watched some of dfvs videos youll realize that gme was a value play the short squeeze was just the cherry on top i have seen over the past two weeks a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on tv and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the moass getting you to believe that gamestops value is from the short squeeze what everyone forgot is how valuable of a company gamestop is now so what changed about gamestop in nov 2020 ryan fking cohen joined gamestops board who is ryan cohen this is the guy who built chewy from the ground up he was in all respects able to build a pet ecommerce empire and directly compete with amazon not only did ryan join the board but he was able to bring along with him chewys coocmo and cfo you know who else is on the board reggie filsaimé the previous president of nintendo americas if you dont know reggie you definitely know his face so now you know gamestop is poised for a shakeup ryan didnt join the board and bring with him two other people because he thought gamestop was going to get squozed he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here valuation im not going to pretend im an expert in valuing companies properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in todays market anymore but to appease the f people here are some facts critics argue brick and mortar retail and as a result gamestop is dying while they arent wrong they fail to also address that gamestop had 300 yoy growth in ecommerce sales gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers physical gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when youre outside of your rooms gaming is huge anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock as cringe as it was ninja hosting the nyc ball drop is testament to this singular game titles like fortnite and minecraft are worth billions alone the gaming industry itself is worth nearly $200 billion and slated to grow double digits yoy there is a great dd written by a vc on why gamestop is going to the moon this market cap matching industry standards should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50bthis is why the short squeeze is distracting many in 5 years if you diamond hands this company the fair value of shares can range from $800$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation to repeat that based on fundamentals alone nothing to do with a short squeeze gme per share could be worth $800 conservatively or $50 billion chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 billion in a smaller market pet products vs gaming so polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds there is nothing wall st can do can make you sell and when this company starts turning itself around youll have been at the ground floor tldr gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now gaming is huge gamestop is positioning itself to be big ps for all you retards everyday you hold your shares is another day melvin and co need to pay interest hold your stocks for at least a year and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income read hold onto your shares for longer less booboo from govt also this is why you dont fking buy on margin or play with options
128,19,2021-02-03 11:29:48,the gme short squeeze pltr black friday for new apes only gather round retards and let me tell you the story of palantir black friday and how sentiments then mirror sentiments now with the massive gme dip in the days leading up to black friday pltr was ripping easily projecting to break the $40s but what happened you say yes thanksgiving happened and although momentum did not actually slow down sentiments did people realized how much tendies they were getting and decided to take profit yes we all know that shitron and the subsequent downgrades were the primary catalysts for pltrs dip and its month long sideways trade but the profit taking due to a day of market closure realized while eating turkey with family was a secondary reason everyone believed that the weekend after black friday would cool negative sentiment and it was just a minor dip but boy were we wrong that baby dropped to $22 after that pltr traded sideways for all of december setting itself up for nice wedges but never happened thousands of accounts were wiped how does this relate to you and the gme squeeze the weekend happened everyone thought this was the week of reckoning but it wasntso far just because the hive mind here thinks something will happen and even if all the ta points to a breakout that doesnt mean it will and in fact the opposite can happen like the other posts have said the market does not care if all of your stars aligned and certainly will not move to confirm your biases there is no defined time limit for how long the hedges can last and they can most likely outlast you unless you play your cards correctly with that being said i do believe the squeeze is yet to come with the stipulation that we collectively hold tldr know your risk tolerance listen to the apes hereif you dare hold gme till we bankrupt the hedges
225,60,2021-02-03 11:29:30,cohen still has the opportunity to buy another 7 seems like a great price to do so a while back i read a very good dd post by ufataspirations talking about how big of a player cohen truly is in all of this given the massive red days weve seen twice this week id really recommend giving it a read but the one point thats important and point of this post is cohen still has a contract to buy another 7 of gme shares he currently owns around 13 and is restricted to owning no more than 20 as part of an agreement obviously he wouldnt want to exercise that right when the price is $350 and he has until the end of 2022 to do it but if he thinks $100 is the new floor or around there wouldnt this be the best time for him to do so every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message why not this one too edit 7 would equate to about 5m shares of a 70m float if my maffs right but am retard 160 $49
1320,145,2021-02-03 11:28:17,gmes data irregularities today i found another irregularity in gmes data when i looked at the positioncost distribution chart for gme after todays close i was expecting it to be very different compared to yesterdays chart since assuming paper hands have sold they would change this distribution significantly and todays volume seemed to be high however i found something fascinating todays chart was a superset of yesterdays chart in other words it looks like some shares were added to the float and it looks like almost none of the previous shares has moved diamond hands goes here take a look position cost distribution comparison between 2121 and 2221 webulls description of what this chart represents is the following source webull if im reading this correctly this means two things 1 it looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float 2 people actually seem to be diamond handing i can see four possible explanations for the new shares add a comment if you see other possibilities 1 gamestop offered shares this didnt happen as far as i know 2 an institution that had shares that werent in the float sold his shares i cant find any filings especially with this many shares but there could be a delay 3 short sellers borrowed shares that were not in the float which probably were covered and returned before and shorted them again 4 naked shorting the reason why i think 1 and 2 are unlikely is that almost all of the sell orders i saw today were trying to bring the price down so an insider or an institution that is not short probably wasnt the one selling they are also probably in a blackout period but im not sure i think 3 is more likely than 4 so i think someone was shorting the shit out of gme today increasing the short interest considerably but heres the thing at the end of the day these new shares seem to be not that many and the same chart seem to be showing that all of the previous shares are already locked i think these shares will be locked in a few dayshours as well if they havent been locked already so this somewhat guarantees a close to infinity short interest furthermore given that all of these shares were shorted at a relatively low price so i believe that whoever did is doing this is just digging his own grave im not sure if this continues or not depends on how many shares they can borrow from institutions but it made me feel better to see people dont seem to be paper handing that much ps i wish webull would put a proper xaxis on this chart that would be very useful ps2 to secgovernment agencies it seems like you dont care about the retail investors but let me give you another incentive if you dont stop these shortselling morons from blowing themselves up over and over again i think you might end up having a legitimate market crashfinancial crisis on your hands it doesnt matter how much money these folks have since these guys are at mercy of the shareholders the supply of shares is extremely low and the demand is extremely high even though the brokerages have artificially reduced the demand for now from what im seeing on this sub and from the data people dont seem to have plans to sell below $1k$10k per share i wouldnt be surprised if that moves up to $50k$100k per share if gme sp reaches $1k$10k do the math yourselves disclaimer im not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice this is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise ive been long gme and have a lot of gme shares i also added a few weekly calls today edit tldr it seems like today did attacked edit2 someone said there is another possible explanation call writers might have dumped their shares if last weeks expired calls were canceled if they hedged them earlier this can also explain the added shares and the dump since market makers might have an incentive to kill next weeks call options
81,48,2021-02-03 11:27:18,okay paperhand pos listen up we gotta think long term earnings is coming up we all need to purchase some physical game copies i dont even need to mention earnings on 325 for said company this is when my hero dfv made his initial decision last year to yolo $50k now we need to blast those numbers buy all future purchase from our favorite game selling store you need a snack go to game stop you need games go get physical copies you need cheesy gifts go to my lord savors favorite store gme earnings will be a blow out im gonna go buy my girlfriends boyfriend a snickers a pack of mms he gets grumpy when hangry edit for people who think this is real dd admittedly i should have flared it satire 
58,21,2021-02-03 11:06:03,dd heavy put option buying made gme go down today as the title suggests just glancing at the option chain today you will see lots of put options being bought today feb 5 100p had the highest volume today at 22k with 7k oi call volumes dont even compare like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100p is now pretty deep itm doesnt bode well for the stock what we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards that halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100 and an iv crush on otm $100 puts wouldve given us some momentum upward but no it just had to happen on the way up anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we dont take back 100 ive been wrong before and i hope im wrong again keep diamond handing though mm has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this they cant do this forever and in fact ive been profiting by selling otm puts at great prices while holding onto my shares i know theta gang isnt welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices or selling puts to expire worthless to gme bears anyways as soon as iv dies down which could take a while its time to start buying yolo fd call options again gme to 42069 is my price target
81,12,2021-02-03 11:00:30,market manipulation and the blame goes to to us canadian authorities gonna investigate in the case of gme because of market manipulation as the stocks felt below 100$ they accusing forums where people manipulate to protect investors may be just maybe let the basic system of a free market work and let supply and demand find a price without restricting the one or the other you dont need a degree in economics to tell that the price go down if you cripple the whole bidside or may be dont halt the stock 50 times on the way up while you only halted a few times when it does the same movement its way down now the boomer media coming after this fraudulent activities with we told you so and blaming the reddit investors for the plunge and stating that their loss their interest and are selling now when dump shorter shorts more than 100 of the available free float and are not willing to pay the price then the side of the trade is evil and dump for doing a rational good trade fuck this free market its only a free market as long they win if they start to lose in this game they change the rules the referee choosing their side and the camera man on the field doesnt films the fouls of them instead they showing the innocent as evil and must be punished type of folks

1922,329,2021-02-03 10:51:15,the truth about the state of the sub ok guys im happy about what has happened with gme and the rest of the bang stonks honestly its inspired a real look into the inner workings of the markets and fucked over some hedge funds who were more likely than not doing shady things if any legal victories come of this whether they create limits on shorting to be under 100 of float or not allowing market makers to double dip whatever it is there may actually be something positive that comes from this on that front that being said this isnt only a gme sub and im not here for a fucking cause to make some political statement or cry about manipulation all day you know why a lot of the original people joined this sub years ago it was to make fuckin money share non conventional ideas go balls deep on some wild plays yolo on earnings share the memes win or lose with my retarded brothers in arms if you made money on gme and rode the wave then im genuinely happy for you if you use a real broker and shorted gme at 420 because thats how you were going to make your fucking tendies im also happy for you were losing our luster and anything else thats not gme and co is getting downvoted to shit or drowned out you know what this sub isnt about the information echo chamber and hive mind bullshit that pervades the rest of reddit i actually hated reddit and made an account years ago but really only got into it because of this sub you post some conspiracy theory bullshit about how every institution is conspiring to ruin the retail traders because gme is down today fuck you youre a fucking idiot because the reality is more institutions actually made money off of this rocketing up than lost by shorting against it who did we hurt 3 hedge funds fuck guys come on you know how much big money was behind this move too its just as plausible that all the bots people are worried about are actually from longs convincing everyone to stay in so institutions can unload the bags onto retail in fact its actually more likely because like i said there are more of them on our side who rode the wave up than the 3 we hurt by it going up ever fucking think of that i expect better and theres nothing wrong with having more people in the sub as someone whos been here since like 300k but you gotta actually cut the shit and put real effort into some of these posts and know that its not about conspiring against the world of institutional investing its about making fucking money thats it wanna know what the best thing about the investment world is if you dont like a fucking trade you can take the other side of it or you can not play it at all we used to have people that bet against each other on the reg and you know whats beautiful about that dynamic we shared our losses and our victories and owned up to it together it wasnt a conspiracy sub it was a sub of autists who won and lost together even if they were on different sides with the end goal of get rich or die trying you would all learn from looking at the history of the sub and some of the quality we used to have please for the sake of keeping this an actually good community chill the fuck out tldr make wallstreetbets great again

8637,619,2021-02-03 10:23:24,the ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the gme selloff over the last few days is shorting not real selling gme  many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders etc the official data are in complete agreement with that s3 and ortex data are estimates but finra data from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated this is the best there is have shown that for the last five days more than 50 of shares sold have been sold short search gme see also 21 129 128 127 pretty plot though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above both sources confirm that short volume has been 50 total volume over the last five days including today as an aside according to that second website if you see more than 20 of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis you may be under a naked short attack sec a little help please in any case the day before robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on gme share and option buying was the last day that more than 50 of all gme shares sold were not sold short shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us we win if we hold this is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash and they definitely havent covered when doing so its mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50 of all shares sold in a day were sold short shorts are instead continuing to double down gme will eventually rise especially if cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon eg official company roadmap released cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can etc it will rise regardless of good news because shorts dont want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways and as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again we can squeeze them once again ive shared finra data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable so im going to answer them below couldnt shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day no because more than 50 of all shares were sold short there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short its mathematically impossible they had to add at least around 10 of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position most days had about 55 of shares sold short some even more and 100 55 45 not sold short 55 45 10 more shares sold short than shares sold long and i know that i bought more over each of the last few days as did you glorious autists so it was probably more than 10 of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days the total volume from those websites is less than the days volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded yes thats because finra only records data from specific marketsexchanges not all of them although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market the ratio of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market because they pull from the biggest exchanges as mentioned above finra is also the highest quality short data the official bimonthly short data that is published is by finra pulling from these same data these data are accurate x200b edit to add i am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice make up your own mind about everything also i am long gme tldr shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days keep holding dont sell and when you can buy more buy more gme to fucking orions belt

1854,224,2021-02-03 09:47:24,this may be the right way to support gme for long term success and get rewarded as a real shareholder just a thought what if 8 million wsb retards forget about the short squeeze instead slowly accumulate shares with hard earned cash not the money borrowed from your wifes boyfriend not margin many of us just like the company if each retard accumulates 18 shares we would own 200 of the whole company and nobody says you cant have more than 18 shares then we all support ryan and his team to build gme into a trillion dollar company gme could grow into an online giant in gaming finance news online brokerage the company would have 8 million loyal customers on day one 
1013,237,2021-02-03 09:31:50,median number of gme shares owned by the average wsb user so we have got a lot of shit being flung all over here today and surprisingly you apes have been the least problematic bunch were heard all sorts of talk many but not all being bots the shorts have covered its over i cashed out but sadly it was during last weeks premarket at 510 and not 515 you guys are retarded and should sell i burned my house down for the insurance money and put it into gme along with my life savings at $450 and now im long rope i sucked 185 dicks for 185 bucks and got 1 gme share today but then i sold because this is taking too long so to ease your minds ive taken the time to post this poll on wsb and found the median amount of shares owned by the average wsb user the data set ranges are a bit wide but for a median it works just fine and may actually be a bit of an underestimation so the number of shares the average wsb user owns 8 that may not seem like much but lets just check out the number of new wsb users in recent times i checked subreddit stats and saw that on jan 23rd we had about 2m redditors on wsb today that number is over 8m now lets be very generous and say 30 of the total number of users are actually bots 10 lurkers 10 with 0 shares well then that means 4m x 8 shares 32m shares is in control of over 50 of the available shares and let me make it just a bit more interesting if those 4m holders theoretically bought 4 more shares each we would own the available float on gamestop and we could literally set our price with no room to fuck around we would effectively own gamestop tldr the average wsb user owns 8 shares some math shows thats about 32m shares out of about 47m float buy more shares lets fuck the institutions who have fucked you over as long as youve been alive edit this is not financial advice i just like the stock do whatever the fuck you want im buying more edit shoutout to my boy jbreezerfreezer who did the math because im retarded also yes its far from exact maffs edit mandatory 33 shares at 8756 average edit new math accounting for potential 0 shares

748,150,2021-02-03 08:17:38,gme simplified supply vs demand i love how cuban put it the reason gme is down is because there is not enough demand mostly due to rh restricting in the past week the enemy has done a mighty good job of making this stock look less appealing we need to counter it by making people want this stock we cant just like it we must love it and make others love it we need to remind everyone of the mission and whats at stake even if it doesnt squeeze if we just keep buying the stock it will go up and nothing will bring on the squeeze more than the price going up tldr we cant just hold we must buy oh and this is not financial advice i love the stock
0,37,2021-02-04 04:08:22,where did you move your gme gains to so i know a lot of this sub is still in battle but for those that took profits already where are you investing your profits i ended up more than doubling my account took the gains and parked them between arkf arkg arkk arkq and csxe been going nice these past couple days though ill definitely miss those 100 days lol but yeah after the stress gme took on me im ready to sit in etfs for a little and do some boomer passive investing whats yalls next plays
79,12,2021-02-04 04:06:39,new stimulus checks may be the fuel to send gme higher again unlike prior rounds where stimulus checks were spread around amongst many big tech stocks this go around stimulus checks may go straight into gme and that concerted buying effort may be the catalyst that sends gme much higher now that new short positions may have been reestablished in the $200$400 range for the record i do not have a position yet and would never entertain buying gme under normal conditions because the fundamentals are not there but i will be watching closely what the stimulus package will look like and how big if they tighten the brackets of who receives checks or not
160,16,2021-02-04 04:01:13,dont paper hand gme due to boomer bots real sentiment data all right retards we are seeing a lot of bots spreading shit about gme and pushing some other stocks i track market sentiment about various stocks using nlp on data from both reddit and twitter after analyzing more than a million comments and tweets the live and longterm sentiment for gme is very positive dont be swayed by the bots pushing negative narrative x200b the live sentiment has been consistently growing since the market open time in gmt x200b x200b after a brief surge of negative sentiment due to biased news reports gme is back to being positive obviously this isnt financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyway stay safe and remember the golden rule

121,37,2021-02-04 03:49:27,probability of ryan cohen buying 7 of gme important to read if youre holding gme okay so i personally think that that gme is going to trade relatively sideways until we see another catalyst the new technology executive announcement is definitely very positive but doesnt have the same spark as an elon tweet i think as many of my fellow bag holders are all hoping that ryan cohen exercising his right to purchase 7 of gme will provide the spark we need to get back on track to the 400500 and beyond range so ryans a smart guy i think he recognizes where this company can go and the massive gaming and e sports industry that is only on the rise its obvious there is strong pricing support at the $90 range if $90 is the new floor which i believe it is and ryan cohen may as well what is the probability of him exercising this right id say we have a 5050 chance that he announces the purchase of these shares this week i think gamestop is going to piggyback off of their latest executive hire announcement into this and fully come out as a onlineecommerce transitioning company i think that their competitor ea sports is going to amplify this need with their latest results as dow jones newswire says today the game publishing giant reported late tuesday a 19 jump in net bookings for the december quarter driven by digital sales and its live services the company noted that 62 of its new game sales for the quarter were digital compared to 49 in last years holiday period digital game sales create two problems for gamestop one they generally dont move through gamestop stores with the exception of those driven by cards that the retailer sells tldr 50 chance that gme has been quietly lurking and just waiting for the right time to announce with ryan cohen they wanted to wait for all you paper handed btches to bounce sincerely 120 gme avg 64

45,48,2021-02-04 02:04:59,greed the moving goalpost winners losers i hope all of you make money please before you downvote hear me out and read the post exactly as the title says i have been concerned about the moving goalpost by some people and the greed that it conveys related to gme $42069 was a meme price target for a while until it was hit and people just moved their goalposts to something higher it seems that people need to learn how to take profits at some point we are here to make money arent we so dont give me that altruistic line about holding forever and joining together for something bigger than ourselves you are participating in the market there are winners and there are losers and my advice for some of these new people are to pick a price and sell at that price now if your price is $1000share or beyond thats great and i hope you reach it but my comments are specifically targeted at the people who never intended to make money and instead treated this all like purchasing a ticket to some kind of bourgeoisie rebellion pick a price and learn to take profits at some point so you can continue participating in the market i hope all of you make money
0,75,2021-02-04 01:53:29,gamestop irony besides all the noise what do you guys see in this company what am i missing i am long term investor and love to make some quick cash i dont like the current stock manipulation and i think wall street made a bad decision conspiracies aside what is good about gamestop not to long ago you could see trending stories about how gamestop has the worst business model customer support and trade in prices i myself rarely bought anything from gamestop because it was never convenient it was like going to a car salesman which i now do online too pc games for the most part were always sold online i remember as soon as consoles caught up to online downloads i never bought a physical game again gamestops atmosphere always sucked and looked like a dated museum i much rather of gone into bestbuy or target gamestop is also a pawn shop model with games and gimmick collector toys ebay amazon already dominate this used market people want to buy new things and the used market has been established for a long time what is positive about gamestop the preorder line waits and the memories having to wait for halo or gears of war that is an archaic thing that no one longer does preorders can be placed from the comfort of a home and the download queued gamestop recently hired a ecommerce ceo the only thing that can keep gamestop going at this point is consumer loyalty no one is buying from gamestop all of the gme shareholders do not buy games from gamestop and will not shareholders are obsessed with hording money and making money so after wall street short sellers are beaten i believe gme will become a worthless piece of trash edit also another note i think wsb will just become wall street after this once the money transfers all the crooked shady ruthlessness will continue online on chat forums like this one
525,42,2021-02-04 01:49:11,at this point its not about money this crime needs accountability sup retards like all of you ive been watching gme price being driven down as i holdthey owe us a squeeze and we can still get it weve seen several takes on the brokers decision to restrict retail buying in some cases allowing sell orders only but what is usually left unsaid is that for someone to sell there has to be someone on the other side buying so by preventing retail from buying the only option is selling to them and they get to cover their shorts at the same time they get to set the price because retail cannot take the buying side of the trade to balance the supply demand pair that with a relentless media fud campaign and theyre making the influenceable retail investor help them cover their shorts at lower prices they cannot cover their shorts if retail investors hold a substantial amount of the volume out of the market even if they lend our shares theyll just be covering shorts by creating new shorts meaning short interest remains unchanged and the squeeze will have to be squoze eventually why because the more they wait the more they spend on interest and going forward more good news are coming regarding the business transition to ecommerce like todays appointment of new cto tldr if retail investors hold get disclaimer idk wtf im talking about im a retard this is not financial advice etc edit position gme commons avg $140 gme weeklies 500c feb 51219
108,14,2021-02-04 01:48:28,clarification on short ladder attacks and round lots vs odd lots so i have seen a lot of posts pointing to gme and others volume as an indication of short ladder attacks while im not claiming they are or arent happening i think it is important to understand how institutional trading works for reference i work on the sell side so im a semisuit im not an execution trader but i have enough friends who are you may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments this is by design and has a name theyre called round lots and are used to break up large orders these round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bidask walls and ensure orderly markets they are not evidence of a short ladder attack think about it if a fund wanted to buy $1000000000 worth of aapl they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them and a limit order would never fill they could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order or find a willing partner for a block trade they also very frequently have to use low touch vwap volume weighted average price algos much different than prop algos to buy in the open markets on an exchange these algorithms ingest the order and then execute the trade based on a predefined of volume ie the sell side execution trader never wants hisher orders to take up more than xx of volume as the algo operates throughout the day it executes thousands of round lot trades these round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day all the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades blocks not in increments of 100 shares tldr 100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack they simply show institutional order flow positions 30 shares of gme at $1407 most importantly hold the line edits with interesting questions q if youre going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100 a theyre not choosing 100 shares their order is much larger probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares the algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade the reason for this is simple its easy to match 100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders if the seller is asking $xxxx for 100 shares the buyer can bid $xxxx for 100 shares and the match is made if you have 13 shares at one price 29 shares at another price and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side complexity increases materially q why do i see a lot of odd lots in ah trading a because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a mm so they just execute an odd lot order it is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above
85,13,2021-02-04 01:45:08,not just a holder but a sharehodler i am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice my brain is glassy smooth tldr do what you can to increase the value of gme you can do this by holding with conviction buying more shares understanding the value of gme and gamestop increase goodwill spending and publicity of gamestop and participate in onceayear shareholder meetings many of us bought gme for the quick buck and had the hedge funds not pulled their bullshit last week it would have popped off instead they have mitigated some risk and pushed back the deadline trying to buy themselves more time in the hopes that we will give up and sell in turn many of us are tapped out or overleveraged seriously dont bet more than you can afford to lose if you are over that amount already do what you can to mitigate also determine your risk tolerance the hedge funds looked at the events last week and changed tactics sharehodlers can as well understand that this is a long term strategy but whether you plan to hold the stock for a short term or a long term this is beneficial to all of us and gme we dont know when the full squeeze will happen thus a longer term strategy on top of your current will benefit us all what does being a sharehodler mean now that you own a share or more of gme gamestop has a fiduciary requirement to maximize the value of the stock as a sharehodler you can help them and in turn increase demand for your shares by doing any of the following things you can do to be a good gme sharehodler a hold your shares with conviction b increase your voting power buy more shares if its within your risk tolerance and you are not overleveraged c understand the future value of the shares you hold i highly recommend checking out which was created by wsb members question this challenge it and come to your own conclusions they make a fair argument that gme is legitimately worth $32 and $169 but that does not consider the positive impact that this all squeeze will have on the company more customers will hear about the executives efforts to rebuild the brand more people will choose to buy from gamestop instead of amazon etc to consider the impact of this i propose a multiplier of between 11 and 13 bear case $352 to $416 bull case $1859 to $2197 remember the stock market deals in future value not present day value additionally understand what gamestop has to offer and enwikipediaorgwikigamestopowned_brands_and_concepts e increase gmes goodwill your spending at gamestop and promote gamestop goodwill is an asset line item on the fiscal quarterly goodwill and asset impairments here anything we can do to increase the fair market value or future value of gme will increase the pressure on short sellers yes this means people spending gme earnings on donations is extremely beneficial as that adds to the goodwill line item f participate in gme shareholder meetings maybe the squeeze gets drawn out or maybe you are long gme either way the shareholder meeting is likely to be around midjune 2021 if retail investors own over 50 of the voting shares we can force institutions who have been lending out their shares to recall them temporarily stop lending their shares to short sellers so that they can vote to counter retail voting power shareholder meetings only occur once a year
137,50,2021-02-04 01:40:37,gme victory conditions for hedge funds vs the unwashed masses actual dd double down i think we should discuss how either side of the trade wins we all know about short interest possible short ladder attacks low volume and all that but there is an argument i read yet the further the price goes down the more difficult it is to actually push it lower if these funds swapping around shares is the primary driver of the collapse in price then they will confront a prisoners dilemmatype situation seeing the possibility of the largest bomb in financial history detonating each financial firm that has gone short knows full well that others want to cut their losses lick their wounds and fight another day as we know if one firm closes some of their shorts the demand and the price increase but the bomb is still there looming in the background the worstcase scenario for holders of gme is the steady unloading of shorts over a long period of time where the deloading process is less expensive than the margin interest that these firms have to pay to keep their shares so think the price of gme remaining steady at like $20 or $30 for months an acceptable loss for hedge funds to do this almost every short fund would have to agree to collaborate in nearperfect harmony and as we know that is nearly impossible its going to take a really long time for us to go back to $17 this is just not possible in the short run to make matters worse for the firms the short interest increased to around 212 the bomb has only grown more dangerous as long as this is the case you should hold months can feel like years but if we are resilient and gme actually does decently as a company these short positions are going to bleed out i just dont see how unwinding these positions is probable when a single closed position could set off the bomb but then again i dont know how to read and yes id like a large soda with that gme to the moooooooonnnn 
140,62,2021-02-04 01:21:27,gme can we drive price up  ive seen a lot of posts saying that the price for gme is being pushed down because they are selling back and forth to each other at lower and lower prices i dont know enough about any of this but if they can drive the price down by going back and forth can we not do the same amongst ourselves by selling back and forth to each other at a higher and higher rate i imagine not because if we put share out there to sell we dont have the option to buy specifically from one another right in the mean time i am holding my 42 shares 317 like the rest of you
172,89,2021-02-04 01:20:43,nok is taking off thursday whether youre in on it or not use it to fund $gme and put the final nail in hedge funds coffin tldr nok is gonna have such amazing earnings this thursday that even boomers will start buying it up in bulk leading to a massive rise in the price of the stock get in now and reinvest those sweet sweet gains into $gme bonus hedgies also heavily short nok so it going up makes them bleed too do not sell your gme to make this play gme only gets fully squeezed if theres additional capital coming in gme doesnt get squeezed if enough people sell that the hedgies can escape but chances are good youre either too smoothbrained or not smoothbrained enough to have all of your assets in on gme so youve got something you can put on nok to make some quick bucks and then reinvest to gme the hedgies bleed when nok goes up less than gme but still good and theyll bleed more when you can triple your investment in gme cause of these gains remember robinhood wouldnt have banned buying nok or gme if they couldnt lose their shirts on it going up

329,94,2021-02-03 22:51:09,gme checkmate theory what if we wsbretail push the issue and call our brokerages to demand copies of our share certificates its a bit old school and there may be fees involved but if we can demand proof of ownership of our shares or proof that brokerages cannot provide proof of ownership wouldnt that place the onus on the people who oversold the stock there may be fees involved to submit the request for stock certificates but the upfront cost of authenticity may be worth the potential gains of exposing counterfeit shares and having a legal leg to stand on forcing a buyback from the institutions that oversold short and are failing to deliver triggering the greatest squeeze the world has seen please proof my logic shares were soldissued by gme to investorsinstitutions institutions took those shares and placed bets against them other institutions took those bets and resold them to other firms other firms traded those bets all the way down to the retailer i want proof that the share i own is a legitimate gme backed share i go to the broker and say show me where my shares came from the broker says here are your stock certificate ids if the hypothesis that retail owns more of the available float is true then brokers will be unable to provide cusids on the shares issued they will have to go back to who they bought the shares from and say i need to see ownership of these shares the institution they purchased the shares from will have to provide proof these are the shares we sold you this traceability should be able to go all the way back to gme for verification but if someone somewhere along the way produced counterfeit shares this will identify who the culprit is then we have a fighting chance edit umcuban one more question please
492,115,2021-02-03 21:12:27,the main takeaway from away this is not to hold to fuck hedgefunds its not a battle between the rich and the poor and its not about how the system is rigged the main takeaway is to not invest money you are not ready to lose i saw many many people here yesterday saying they invested their tuition money their life savings their house payments and overall money they could not lose ive been in this sub when it was 2m and ive seen astounding gains and terrible losses never posted because i never could afford to own a stock or to put money i was willing to lose with this gme i thought that maybe it was time to try and play with the stock market so i dug up $100 bucks i had laying around and bought some fractional shares at 418 im down 70ish but my mind could not have been better i literally dont care if i lose this money as that was my mentality going into this like the rest of you retarded apes im holding forever please im not a financial advisor but merely a human one do not put money that you are not absolutely ready to lose lastly see you on the moon edit retarded version and tldr as a bonus cant lose not a loss if you 
12,30,2021-02-03 21:04:20,adding $bbby under $30 per share to your short squeeze arsenal is a crazy smart play right now my ape brain went in for 37 shares of $bbby bed bath beyond last wednesday at $38 a share along with 12 $amcs at $16 145 $gmes at $324 holding and today i went to dump the $bbby shares but after looking into it $bbby under $30 is the best bet for a short squeeze play on the market right now because even if the squeeze doesnt happen the stock will gain value reading this you will learn 1 $bbby has a constant uptrend 2 $bbby has staying power 3 $bbbys uptrend will continue through the summer and possibly fall 4 $bbby stock will not only give you a short squeeze opportunity but is has long value of 10 in 6 months over its current price at its current price $bbby has long trend value even at 6 months during this cycle which im starting after the covid correction in march $bbby has had a fairly constant uptrend that even after the first january correction has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higherlow line $bbby is a healthy company but so called smart money thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the covid stuff ends buying home goods during the stayathome orders is what they call nesting which is why so many of them shorted the stock but $bbby will be fine for at least the next 6 months or even 9 months were not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways which will continue the nesting trend for another good quarter or two and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $bbby so that means current investors are holding that brings the trend price based on the higherlow line to about $33 in july 10 where the current stock price is at now heres the best part most apes on here who pay attention know that this stock is shorted by 65 heres a list if youre new of all the companies on this list $bbby is the only one with a very healthy trend line compared to its current stock price even at a stock price between $25$30 which is above $bbbys current higherlow trend line in 5 months $bbby will be worth $33 there is still a 10 growth there a lot of retail and instutional investors are hip to this and they like the stock so they are holding if another gme sortsqueeze is going to go kaboom on another stock its probably going to happen to $bbby and soon the last settlement date for shorts was on friday with 51 million shares but have 11 days to cover the next settlement date monday february 14th 625 million shares have only 5 days to cover on february 28th 64 million shares will need to be settled with only 5 days to cover if $bbby is a healthy stock that has a current price under $30 and a long price of $33 for july 2021 10 its current value its being shorted at 62 retail and intuitional investors are holding and 126million shares are going to have to be settled by the end of february heres my observations on why bed bath beyond $bbby stock is going to be healthy for a long time i call them the doubles double the amount gatherings at other peoples homes in 2021 hedge fund belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad

161,17,2021-02-03 19:30:24,deliver the morning news and catch the plague the intention of this post is not to suggest a price target nor predict the future direction of $gme but to instead address some of the fear that spread through the public yesterday and made the panic there were many who delivered the morning route directly onto the lawns of those who scripted the headlines the night before the question is though how many how many delivered to the hedge funds while they strolled out onto the front lawn of their mansions in their ugg boots sipping their freshly brewed covfefe how much of the trading volume was and how much was im just your average my thumb is barely opposable luckily yahoo finance allows you to navigate its site by simply licking the keys after a couple short circuits resulting from my overly fluid salivary glands i stumbled upon the following trading data this isnt no technical shit i can only count to 10 luckily for me that is all that i need below you will see the open high low and close for the past few weeks now im no wrinkle brain but i see a lot of 0s for us dumb who randomly mash buy at market only who are whipped into line by their evil overlords have the mental capacity to target numbers such as 0 with such precision but you just drew triangles around numbers with red crayon you might hear yourself ask well youre wrong theyre fucking rectangles retarded aside coincidentally there are lots of red rectangles over the previous week of trading this to me highlights when our good pal came to visit from jan 26th till 28th the crayon is only scribbled over the daily high is this from scrambling to buy back shares in an illiquid sell depth maybe maybe just had limit sells because they like taking while not looking the more interesting part is that 7 out of 9 price points over the last three days have fingerprints on them to put this in perspective the next 00s not in this picture isnt until jan 4th and the next is on dec 11th not many 00s this is more than coincidence now we all know the have powered up and skynet is coming for us but the questions remains were there enough to allow the shorts to exit or was it mostly just playing ring around the rosie and passing plague ridden tissues to each other while the foundations of melvin and citadel start to crumble if it was the latter then the are going to have to work extra hard now that we only have and is fuelling for launch positions 60$gme $128 average tldr lots of volume if then

263,59,2021-02-03 18:06:28,how and why nok will reach the moon nok will colonize the moon and bring 4g to barbaric aliens nasa selected nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon first in regards to nokias business nokia unfortunately doesnt manufacturer phones anymore nokia sold the right to produce nokia branded phones to hmd global while retaining the right to have some input nokias current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5g network infrastructures and cloud services in other words nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization especially so the postcovid world where networking is even more important than before think of the tesla cars they are connected to att cellular networks which are built by nokia nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation and when that happens nokia will have a continuous revenue stream nokia is leading mobile networks with 27 of the world excluding china market share of 4g and 5g it currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5g nokia other major competitors are ericson huawei and zte some countries of the western hemisphere and the g7 banned chinese companies such as huawei and zte from operating in their countries i suspect this will continue in the future leaving us with only nokia and ericson but couldnt a megacap such as google or tesla somehow eliminate nok and eric nok holds more than 3000 patents already so there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business that wont happen unless nokia licences a patent for such a company in this hypothetical scenario the megacap would have to acquire nokia which in turn will raise the price of the stock i think this is the case that is similar to msft under ballmers where the stock price was stagnant for many years but slowly surged under nadella though given the catalyst of covid19 i think the surge will happen quicker with nok at 453 a share nok pe ratio is 3081x which is a small discount in comparison with the sp 500 which has pe ration of about 39x this establishes nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock the lowest that nok dropped to was 234 which happened back in march at the current price i believe that nok is well within the margin of safety with that being said there are some problems that should be addressed the income trend in the past few years is problematic but this can offset by the fact that nok has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until nok is able to eliminate huawei and zte and in turn dominate the market with ericson also nokia is spening billions on research the second complication is that biden or other g7 leaders could potentially reverse trumps ousting of huawei and zte i dont think this is likely but its certainly a possibility but even if it happens nokia will still have a big market share and 100 market share of the moon and will always have a priority over huawei and zte for government projects for reasons of national security also there is a substantial amount of money spent on rd which will i believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in nok it should be worth noting that just one day after rh banned nok blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of nok increasing their shares by 21140777 shares form sc 13ga nokia corp published 20200205 121619 and the new one showing the increase form sc 13ga nokia corp published 20210129 172109 even though at this point blackrock owns 5 of practically everything the increase is a good question now you might ask me why not ericson eric is also a good stock but i see more value in nok also the fact the nok is working on 1 terabit per second internet and that it will bring 4g to the moon and the fact that nokia is 1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth final words gme to the moon and pigs get slaughtered
56,26,2021-02-03 17:21:36,what if gme were to bring back their generous quarterly dividend payment hey retards what if gme were to start declaring a quarterly dividend again last paid out mar 2019 $038share before shorts started attacking looks like the vermon holding short positions would be responsible for payment to the owners of the shares delivertheshares if the they didnt buy back before x dividend date x200b tldr buy the fucking dip and hold ffs stay the course x200b x200b short stocks and dividend payments shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price 1 if the price falls there is a profit if the price rises to $51200 there is a loss the stock needs to be borrowed from a shareholder to sell it without owning it a brokerage firm usually handles this process there is generally a borrowing fee for the stock depending on its availability and liquidity additionally the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any dividends x200b 2 if an investor is short a stock on the record date they are not entitled to the dividend x200b 3 in fact the investor is instead responsible for paying the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed special considerations shorting stocks are considered risky and appropriate only for sophisticated traders melvin is a dumbass due to the general upward trend of stocks borrowing costs and the skewed riskreward nature of shorting over time stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies companies through their business operations protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers this is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time x200b borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock typically between 2 and 10 annually 30 in exceptional cases x200b 4 of course there is the additional cost of paying out dividends this is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task finally basic math works against short selling as well a stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some innovative product x200b im a fucking retard and have no idea what im taking about i like this stonk buying the dips holding since 2017
331,80,2021-02-03 17:18:44,do the the skeptical claims about gme even make sense alright im not going to pretend that i have a deep understanding of finance but some of the comments expressing skepticism about gme reek of pure bullshit heres some of the recent claims ive been seeing 1 the shorts have covered the poster usually cites the massive drop in si as reported by s3 something like 120 going into friday down to 51 going into monday so from a basic supply demand analysis this doesnt add up volume was relatively low compared to motueswed and the prior week most likely due to heavy restrictions or outright bans on buying gme shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues if it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positionspurportedly 70on friday then we wouldve seen a massive hike in price because shorts wouldve been scrambling to buy along with the few institutionalretail investors who werent restricted from buying this basically wouldve been the squeeze but thats not what happened the price did increase yes but it didnt massively spike not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares en masse as is being claimed 2 sure but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top thats why the price didnt spike to squeeze levels no this cant be correct if enough new short positions were opened friday to artificially suppress and hide the supposed massive covering of short positions then the si reported by s3 would not have gone downat least it would not have decreased from 120 to 51 at this point claims 1 and 2 arent even compatible they cant both be true at the same time my guess is shorts have been averaging up their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up cover most of their positions even if it were possible in this short time period and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down it would seem more likely that the si hasnt actually decreased much at all much less over the past 4 trading days 3 the shorts closedare closing their positions this week motues again i dont see how this would work how could shorts be closing en masse while the stock price is in free fall like it has been the last two days when shorts close their shorted shares they buy the stock so if the claim is that theyve been closing their earlier short positions this week then shouldnt we realistically have seen an increase in price especially with mondays low volume at the very least the price shouldve stabilized not plummeted it seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while si supposedly plummeted and without the price spiking to infinity especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them one or more of these claims has to be false right maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppresscrash the price simultaneously in that case si shouldve stayed relatively stable or gone up not crash from previous estimates if the si really did crash meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions then price shouldve erupted if we just ignore the estimated si entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago and the spike at the ah last week was the squeeze that doesnt make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze the price wouldve exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck wouldve been selling at that point what seems more likely is that the ah was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors both retail and institutional hopefully someone can explain what im missing because i feel like im going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half i realize there are legitimate concerns regarding gme moving forward but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable am i just retarded 
3716,327,2021-02-03 17:04:54,if you are holding gme and are worried about the temporary price fluctuations just unplug yourself from the internet eat sleep well go take a short trip play some video games and just enjoy life come back online to check the price in a month lo and behold your portfolio will be on the moon tldr forget that you bought gme and come back a month later remember dfv has been holding gme for more than a year
16,155,2021-02-03 16:59:27,are you sure melvin is still short gme because if theyre not then youre all just playing with yourselves hi former hedge fund trader here first thing in my 8 years trading for wall street firms i never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with gme in fact the only time i ever found myself naked short accidentally it was a huge problem was almost fired massive apologies to the prime broker exchange regulators etc i certainly didnt make that mistake again i can tell you that in europe and asia this kind of shit just doesnt fly however having seen the gme failtodeliver data on the sec website im pretty shocked that us markets appear to be riddled with corruption second thing if youre a trader or pm in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately you never let an error run or dillydally before making things right its my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry ego right or wrong fair or unfair they all go out the window and you take the loss suffer the pain and live to fight another day now lets consider what happened last week gme traded 500m shares if melvin were covering at 14 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares thats twice the floating market cap as such id say melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already in that case youre all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers etoro et al running stops of leveraged customers the only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying gme derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold happy to hear any evidence that theyre still short but beware the integrity of such data all the best

124,105,2021-02-03 15:10:46,takeaways from gme where do we go from here the free market isnt free i have learned a lot in the last two weeks and i hope that some of you have as well and im not talking about the fundamentals of investment trading or strategy im talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another obviously this is an everevolving situation but i think its worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we both as a community and as individuals can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice im not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this its immaterial to my thesis what was exposed first and foremost in my mind is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors if possible we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages andor mirror them for the retail investor ill get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later but first lets dig into the advantages themselves advantages afforded to the institutional investor access to assets one of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets hence there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing the events of last thursday show us this is not the case many if not most brokerages restricted access to an indemand asset leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely but not to buy freely again this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect only an observation that it was the effect that occurred in my opinion rh had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does instead trading directly between one another this creates a submarket that exists directtoseller that retail investors couldnt dream of as such they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in moreover insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale access to information this one is quite a bit simpler institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves uptothemillisecond data on marketwide trends in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move in short while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor access to capital the impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways first the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to singlehandedly impact the market for a stock this is why gme went down into the low single digits to begin with along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts which are illegal as fuck this ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the peoples short squeeze is essentially the same thing so in that sense were on an even playing field right wrong in order for our side to achieve the desired effect we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable as soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands the whole thing falls apart now imagine what would have happened if melvin werent a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will realistically half of them would have paperhanded out long before they shorted 140 of the free float of gme and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point second access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead this is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is citroncitadelmelvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there cant possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose there is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor finally access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless if institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million youd better believe theyll do it every time their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority meanwhile if you or i get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo messageboard theres a very real possibility we go to jail mitigating disparities of access so the game is rigged weve always known that but the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how thats achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that weve never before been empowered if you dont know how youre getting fucked youll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you thats what my dad always told my anyways anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities but the key here is that we start having the discussions if every idea i pose gets torn down because its retarded and im sure that they all are ill still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth i think its time we start to completely reimagine the way that small money invests and that wed be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to and completely independent from the existing stock exchanges of the world this secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities so how do we achieve these goals heres a list of guiding principles ive come up with this marketplace should be open at all times without closures or halts to the sale of any security member traders have access to all their assets at all times to ensure this no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into out of and between one another such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect and allow for builtin avenues for both direct and communitywide communication between its member traders to prevent the manipulation of this exchange limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred into but not out of an account this allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market no liquidity should be required by the exchange itself to achieve this end trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed all accounts should be linked to existing brokeragebank accounts belonging to one person and validated against govissued id this prevents badfaith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts all members profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out this allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading stocks only no short positions dont get me wrong shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and reselling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns all intramarket trades and trends should be visible to all member traders i hope youve enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard my ideas are probably garbage but theyre garbage born of a desire to find a better way even if i havent done that myself i hope that we can do it together apes together strong have a good night edit pretty sure its auto mod but every insightful response ive gotten has been immediately removed cant we do better
498,65,2021-02-03 14:59:31,why im holding gme whether gme comes up or not what i cant let go and why i wont sell is bc all the news networks peddling that we moved to silver for days when we obviously werent and the fact that every time a squeeze was about to happen they stopped allowing us to buy killing the momentum when the price went below 100 they conveniently let us buy again shit is ultra rigged and i feel like every share i hold is a protest every share i hold is another diamond layer on my already diamondencrusted hands gme 40 shares $129 i believe in this stock and i believe in rc
366,59,2021-02-03 14:54:30,banks rigged gme to stop the infinity squeeze and are now trying to get wsb to buy silver so they can make up their losses proof included wall st rigged gme to prevent the infinity squeeze this is a fact they are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position proof included this shows the massive net short position that banks have in the silver futures market and if you want to look it up yourself you can right here wait banks are massively short silver in the futures market yes your title bashed silver though yes its the only way to post about silver right now forgive me wsb gods you want me to sell gme and go into silver no hold your gme and go to the moon if thats your play while gme is the current religious level obsession of wsb there are people who are still interested in other plays were not your enemy wsb used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didnt try to ban one another there is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from gme or something but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market further silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and monday saw silver massively gap up that night the cftc raised margin requirements and today silver plunged when its speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver its the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesnt affect them like it does speculators who are individuals this is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who wont use their margin to max out long positions drastically cut back your leverage or dont use it at all hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration and then take physical delivery the shorts wont be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring the silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than gme but its pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st banks silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents the trade appeals to a broader audience than just wsb though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is
7881,696,2021-02-03 14:40:06,gme urgent reeducation unify clarify focus and execute how can i start this the paradigm that defines our role on gme needs urgent and drastic clarification if we are to steer this thing back onto the roadwhether we want to admit it or not were fucking drifting atm the hype is dying as all hypes do the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability were all poor so we dont care its either moon or bankruptcy th tha tha th time out listen up fucktards im poor too but thats not the point we need to go over the whole situation with perspective and this is not some detailed nerd shit so itll go easy on your 2 braincells repeat after me we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze we are not gonna trigger the shortsqueeze its easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this we are not triggering shit so all the retards yelling buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality its not our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to picture a roman colosseum an old stadium you mongs in the middle of the arena down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing having a jolly good time theres several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading out to freedom to get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit so thats done theyre already there shorting gme to shit not by 13 which was enough to rocket vw share price 5x back in 2008 but by a staggering 50 to 130 numbers irrelevant point is the ammo is more than enough as you can see theres plenty of shorters in the pit so theyre confident and comfortable now for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things a boogeyman something blocking the goddamn exit the boogeyman is anything that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out the less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all meaning the end it could be literally a thousand different things and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will hit could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company ryan cohen for example earnings blowing out anything and this company has received so much free advertising in the last few weeks its not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point not gonna get into the reasons why its already a great value investment and it will soon show then we come we the group of individuals that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it what are we we are bodies pilling up on the fucking exits the more shares you own the fatter you are and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit and my friend my friend the hedgies are really gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comesif something big drops and theres not enough unflinching share ownership buyers that wont sell no matter what then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen sure there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover say most of the gme board for example and maybe a couple institutions but likely not nearly enough thats our part if say half the people on wsb buy an average of 5 shares that would be nearly 20 million shares thats nearly 13 of the total gme shares availableif say over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person half of wsb would own a staggering 60 of all the shares and you may say oh well thats not possible but just think about it many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands some even millions each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lotheck even i with my 20 shares god bless them can make up for 3 people on wsb that bought nothing time really is on our side if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply arent enough shares to cover gme goes straight to the moon we dont need to worry at all there is no losing here because mathematically its a time bombthis will not survive on hypehype is not our friendunderstanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed we need to unify clarify focus and execute x200b tldr the gme gang is losing its way because its all hype now hype will kill this because hype dieswe need to clarify our role and execute with patience we dont trigger short squeezes our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops the shorters try to cover but cant because we have all the stock or most of it they panic and gme moonsbasically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can and to understand your role this diamond hand shit is not needed because the price is irrelevant its the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and thats where the focus needs to be x200b obviously this isnt financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways

369,52,2021-02-04 09:33:19,gme looking at some data lets look at some charts again and try to figure out what went on today before that i just want to make sure people understand that im just looking at some data and guessing what is happening i do that mainly for myself because i dont fully trust anyones judgment and i want to be in charge of my decisions i could be wrong i think you should do to same try to gather as much information as possible process that information and make up your mind if you lose money this way instead of following people blindly at least you learn from your mistakes lets jump into it based on the positioncost distribution from today from webull i see that yesterdays pattern happened again there was a decent amount of shares added to the float take a look position cost distribution comparison 22 vs 23 todays change however is slightly different as you can see it looks like a relatively small amount of shares went from below $92 to above it this could be due to either some profittaking daytrading or scalping note that stock price went up but total profited shares proportion is slightly down because of both of these short selling as soon as price went up and some profittakingday tradingscalping i personally think that the bigger pattern is the new shares that seem to be added to the float and there has been a lot of short selling activity in the past two days 21 vs 22 vs 23 where are they getting these shares from i have no idea another thing that keeps happening i posted about it here the first time i noticed is that i see a lot what looks to be fake orders with weird numbers i dont know what these are they dont look real but i also doubt that they are just a glitch and my previous guess explained in a previous post was probably wrong because today i saw this weird orders with very high sp as well as this weird orders with very low sp so if anyone has a plausible explanation for these weird orders please let me know ps there are massive open interests on both put and call options that expire this friday so things might get extremely volatile again x200b disclaimer im not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice this is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise ive been long gme and have a lot of gme shares and a few gme call options edit tldr it seems like today mostly did attacked
165,12,2021-02-04 09:11:27,dont trade on margin if you want to have diamond hands margin is alluring because it gives you control of money you do not have but keep in mind that you are borrowing money from your broker with interest and the broker will liquidate your position if you fall below a threshold eg 33 50 etc depending on your broker if you are margin called some brokers will call you and give you time to add additional funds which you may not have or liquidate your positions before they are force liquidated however if you look into the contractual language between you and your broker they are not obligated to give you a heads up moreover given that they are likely bombarded right now and probably have an incentive to liquidate your positions they are mostly likely allowed to manually liquidate your position eg your gme long positions you cannot diamond hand a position that is manually liquidated by your broker some of you may say that you cant even go on margin on gme that is true for some brokers if you want to trade gme dont go on margin trying to trade any other equity do not give your broker a chance to liquidate your positions x200b i have never held nor do i intend to ever hold any long or short position in gme
1659,180,2021-02-04 08:45:19,just to clear up the sec probe misunderstandings so i think we should all be clear that the sec is investigating whether institutional influence happened in this sub they dont give a shit whether some 19 year old yolod his allowance on 05 shares of gme they want to know whether other hedge funds mightve manipulated this sub into buyingselling whatever in their interest source this is described in the sentance may in fact have been professional investors looking to capitalize on the forums fervor i know everyone here thinks that wsb is in charge but in reality there are large institutions both long and short on this play wsb is basically a toddler sitting at the world series of poker table

133,28,2021-02-04 15:56:01,the real value behind gme indepth dd legitimate argument to invest in gme at these prices short sqeeze and hype arent reasons sherman started a turnaround of gamestop when he first took over april 2019 he cut the dividend began consolidation cut some fatty stores and began debt reduction covid threw a wrench in this because he didnt move online nearly fast enough when burry first invested in gme there was a reason what reason he spoke with sherman about his plans cohen also had a similar situation and later of course he got involved sherman listens to both and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move gamestop forward next up we see the microsoft deal although exact numbers arent available that i can find gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via microsoft microsoft is also expanding gamestops inventory on the inside and employees will use microsoft software to run the stores microsoft doesnt want gamestop to fail nor will they let them with 27 of new games bought at gamestop and 40 of used games bought there microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle we recently saw gamestops holiday earnings with a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil they were unprofitable this year however this is expected to change with earnings starting in march they are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt how are they going to pay this off liquidating stores and consolidation this was a cohen continuation idea that sherman had started just without the vision to make it succeed a small stock offering lets say 2 would also leave them in an excellent financial situation additionally we have the 300 yoy online sales increase which accounted for over 30 of total sales this is only expected to increase moving forward while overall sales decreased by 3 yoy inefficient stores were cut out of the picture comparative store sales increased by 5 yoy but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on nonessential businesses places that had significantly fewer covid numbers had over 30 yoy growth next we have the chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors out with the old in with the new even though most directors were acquired in 2020 these new additions add incredible value to the company sherman listens to cohen cohen and friends had some focuses at chewy that led to insane amounts of profit they focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency expect the same for gamestop this was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership all ears are on cohen and his ideas to make gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop most recently were the adds today francis that aws engineering guy thats now heading technology nice durkin customer service vp from chewy is now in charge of gamestops customer service fuck yes chewy has insanely good customer service krueger big filler boi from amazon et all now running ecommerce fulfillment dope tldr idc about a squeeze or hype but i like the stock but what do i know im literally retarded and not a financial advisor positions about $300k in gme and another $250k more in cash waiting for a drop if it happens obligatory 
85,19,2021-02-04 15:49:20,gme is still extremely undervalued here are the real reasons why first we examine the 1m graph do you see the two mountain peaks good now we pivot over to the himalayas you can see changste and nirekha just below everest we havent even started that final ascent yet and were climbing without oxygen tanks next say it out loud gme ghb yup that one melvin citadel rh who knows who else be slipping it in our drink but we aint bending over we need to remember everything everything theyve done to keep us down and they aint off our back yet volume 427m today 60 day avg 2389m almost double whys the volume so high this is a party people like to listen to loud music thats an insanely high number of decibels put in your plugs at least 2 but more is recommended tinnitus is not great fundamentals 69m shares outstanding yup its one of those parties 628b cap full of ghb walk up to a stranger baby like can i suck your tongue 121 float snorted 2000 high and cant even see the ground it lit everyone want in rumors flying dirty tricks everywhere snakes trying to lure us away and swallow us whole pigs trying to blow this house down dont forget though this is a movement not just the paper yo we gotta take the power back and we about to shoot past the moon strap on your helmets retards 
95,25,2021-02-04 13:43:50,completely neutral take on $gme okay okay okay jesus christ you guys are like 5 year old siblings in the back of a 1999 toyota tacoma throwing blind punches while crammed in a 3 foot tiny square seat behind your dads back titties had to get that off my chest the animosity between bulls and bears on $gme lately is absolutely ridiculous bears its not how this sub always was to completely shit on people for holding a position let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if youre so sure theyre screwed as long as youre only dealing with money you have to lose and not liquidating your roth to play a gamble then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else bulls however the number of people saying itll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue they know that this event will likely stay on peoples minds for years to come especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play already this week we see that were at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process im personally bullish gme 69 $gme98 and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now even though im anal about it im not using emotions to dictate my investment i truly believe in the value of gamestop under cohen and the new vps they signed on today and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that im still not selling truly we wont know for sure whether theres the potential for another squeeze short or gamma until those numbers come out from the finra this next tuesday the 9th ive heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but i havent been able to find the source on this myself since the opinions on this are so binary there will be no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts are or are not in until this point it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze since attention will be redirected toward a shortterm high growth conversely even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and were sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two the stock would likely only go back up when the for this key reason i think this situation is a 5050 gamble if youd like to keep the gamble going or feel like the losses arent worth realizing then fuck it you do you i hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor if youre not willing to take the gamble then dont and stop dicking in the ass everybody whos willing to make a truly retarded play after all the spirit of this place isnt so black or white tldr we dont know what the fuck is going on but its your choice what you do with your money pay attention but dont let hecklers or theorists obscure your vision of the future position gme long newly into green energy

idea about the whole gme thing until last week i bought the first share as a lotto ticket the last two were the easiest shares ive ever bought i hope the squeeze happens but if not i still consider this an investment im happy to make and thats how i consider it now an investment i bought a lotto ticket on gamestop stock realized i own shares in this phenomenon called $gme and bought more gamestop is the videogame store that the slowest flakiest weed dealer in the chicagoland area worked at back when i was in highschool $gme i cant define $gme because right nowit is simply beyond $gme is at the center of a movement that got support from aoc and ted cruzat the same time in 2021 $gme has been given the most aggressive effective and expansive advertising campaign in the history of anythingfor free communist dictators struggle getting the same amount of coveragein their own regimes $gme has a fucking $nflx movie already optioned mass news coverage worldwide real or not the fucking internet the rocket emoji wtf else could it be associated with now customers buying and donating $gme products to charity people buying billboards all over the world a free street team for everywhere peoples $gme could have more than brand loyalty it has the possibility to have peoples like applefolk i really hope they dont fuck this up i hope to continue being a fan and if there are any $gme execs who think something like well i wouldnt call that adverti then my entire thesis is wrong but after reading ryan cohens letter to the board id be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $gme $gme has money with vision have you read cohens letter i think i read it once two days ago after seeing dfv mention it in one of his posts i read it again earlier today but this time after having read cubans ama that was critical between cohens letter and cubans wisdom something happened i actually like deep in my soul began to like the stock so i stopped trying to daytrade fds to average down shares and took a more intentional look at $gmes story and plan moving forward $gme should be so much more than a video game store in the same way that mcdonalds is so much more than a fastfood restaurant its like when harry sonneborn went to ray crock and was like bro you aint a restaurant owner youre a fucking realestate magnate ray didnt know what he had the template for a business that wouldnt just disrupt the casual dining industryit would define itwho the fuck is the macdonalds of gaming $gme is in a position to wipe out everyone in one of the fastest growing industries in the world we dont even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet just that its gonna be bigger than it already is cohen knows this dfv knows this any of you who have been truly following gme before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion and cuban knows this but i think he saw something bigger did anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or pr disaster just so he can do an ama on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net at a time when its being watched like hawk by fin regulators not only that afterwards he goes on a pr crusade in support of wsb why because this is the place to be and this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level there may be something waaaaaayyy bigger than a squeeze a turn around or even the advent of a gaming empire mass media hysteria aoc and cruz agreeing dogs and cats living together theres something bigger thats possible and im not sure cuban even knows what it is just that its big and since hes mark fucking cubanhe made sure he was in it but even more so took a side and defended a convictionfor what a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze a chance to look cool in front of millennials fuck noand double fuck no to the second one we were all looking at charts wondering what lines do and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded dd that i think we missed the value of $gmes newest asset gme fanatics and the social and cultural phenomenon they started what is the possible financial gain from the spirit geist of the squeeze i have no idea but $gme is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out and this sparks joy and wonder in my soul im grateful to all the work dfv has done but im also grateful he is no longer posting updates the pressure on that man to holdhes still in im still in thats the only comment for like the first 1k comments it was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didnt post an update let alone a stock price have you watched his vids have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is its insane to think about the weight he carried nonetheless im in because i like the stock thats it but i like to think dfv has similar ideas to those explained above and will continue to hold for the same reason i also like to think theres a few vcs out there with similar thoughts maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly good and new lastly all of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions i made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong tldr i actually like the stock

7046,574,2021-02-04 12:35:47,a rational and bullish take on the current state of gme gang i see a lot of fud and bad dd going around rwallstreetbets and its time for more rational discussions about the state of gme and the potential for another bull run it is possible but people need to stop being next level retard it is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on whats actually going on so while i dont know shit and this isnt real financial advice heres a more rational take on what we need to do to get gme moving again full disclosure i was in gme in early december at around $15 i was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely i got back in immediately for feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k i took some profits on the way up i felt bad for doing so but i knew it was the big brain move and in the end i pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me im still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for feb 19th and made more 250 calls recently for feb 26th and feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday im holding all of these till bust so im in it to the moon i have some shares too but those are a long play i dont look at them first we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done the factors that led to it have changed either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices around 200 most likely or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us we cannot count on the original short squeeze to revive this stock what we need is authentic buying and new momentum on that note stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume what we need is real authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200 but right now gme looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole so how do we fix that we still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the globe that want a part in this once in a lifetime story this is powerful but has to be used right and thats hard when the brokers are shutting us out but hope is not lost and restrictions should lift over time we need patience and resilience we also need to stop telling people who arent in this for the moment to hold till they die some people are losing real money over this and were being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the fud worse if we want a come back we need the selling to stop and that means we need to let the weak hands fold while keeping the floor price above a certain level lets talk about volume the recent low volume isnt low compared to the past months its just lower than the day when gme was the most traded stock in the whole fucking world stop talking about volume real selling has happened which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding we need to let this energy run its course dont act like its going to the moon and to buy at any price save our bullets for the hard line in the sand once the selling has stopped and it will we just need to regain momentum with organic buying people all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for gme to look like its picking up steam again and they will pile the fuck on just like last time if we push the price high enough we can trigger another short squeeze but it is not the same conditions as the first one stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks which ive only heard of on this reddit and us being cheated by the big man that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable it is still a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story whether it is or isnt that only creates more fud this sub needs to get its shit together we need real authentic i like this fucking stock for reasons other than the short squeeze like gme just adding a fucking amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online there is real reason to believe in gme and that needs to turn into authentic buying which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again but this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10000 or bust needs to stop its just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief this stock has real potential to hit $300 again we just have to change our mind set and the game plan and im too stupid to tell you how but i know this isnt the way so buy the fuck out of gme at current levels but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality and tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going we have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again its not over but its gonna require patience and time and if you arent in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again at this point if youre not buying either get off the ship or hold till death do us part best of luck retards i know we can do this

123,182,2021-02-04 11:54:03,putting forward an alternative view for $gme firstly i hope this doesnt get downvoted to oblivion this is a genuine discussion i want to have to further help gme holders understand the situation and provide clarity this is in no shape or form financial advice but my opinions on the stock and what has happened i am holding 296 shares avg $37 have we stopped to consider that the squeeze has already happened that initial jump from 100s to 480 last week may have been most of the shorts covering shorts needed to cover approx 70 million shares if you look at the volume day to day from last week 70 million shares could have easily been covered as these days have very high volume this is even truer when you factor in brokerage restrictions if retail couldnt buy where was all of this crazy volume from most likely it was the 70 million shares being covered if it is revealed that the short interest is still 50 or higher this may very well be because hfs took new short positions in the 400s 300s 200s they are rolling in the green if this is the case they probably bought options to also hedge against any potential issues if this is the case the short interest will appear the same on our end but in order for a successful squeeze to take place organically the price will potentially have to hit $500 organically for the new shorts to feel any pressure in terms of percentage as well the jump from early double digits to 480 for gme was a bigger percentage increase than vws jump from 200s to 1000s this solidifies further that the squeeze has happened and the squeeze we saw was bigger than vws in terms of percentage i know a lot of people here got in 200 so it would be great if we could get some solid discussion going on challenging what ive said for the most part it seems the squeeze has happened and any new short interest has a firm grasp
750,85,2021-02-04 11:35:42,serious dd on the greeks for options explained and an analysis of a call option example the final paper using the greeks to analyze a call option contract for gamestop corporation x200b $160 strike price call exp feb 12 2021 gme $160c 212 current price bid x $1000 last x 1083 x ask x1165 current greeks for contract these are important for calculations δ delta 03438γ gamma 00055θ theta 136ν vega 00534p rho 00052 x200b what is delta and how is it used delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions delta is not a static numberit fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security time to expiration and volatility the standard definition of delta is change in the option price change in the stock price why is delta important 1 measuring expected change in option price delta can be used to calculate how much an options premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security for example a call option with a delta of 050 would be expected to rise in value by about $050 if the underlying stock or etf rises by $1 2 calculating the percentage of price risk delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option so a call option with a delta of 070 has 70 of the price risk versus owning the stock outright if an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas 3 determining the probability that an option will expire in the money finally delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be inthemoney by at least $001 or more therefore a call with a delta of 005 only has a 5 chance at that moment in time that the stocks price will be higher than the options strike price at expiration 2321 delta 3438 every $10 up in stock price $3438 what is gamma and how is it used gamma is another widely used metric for options trading it is most often used by traders with large positions but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave the standard definition of gamma is change in the delta change in the stock price why is gamma important gamma measures the rate at which an options delta changes as the underlying security moves the gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security for example a call option with a gamma of 002 and a delta of 050 would be expected to change to a 052 delta if the underlying stock or etf rises by $1 x200b 2321 delta 03438gamma 0055 deltagamma 3493 every $10 up in the stock price $3493 x200b what is theta and how is it used theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an options price the standard definition of theta is change in the option price one day change in time theta represents how much an options premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same for example a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $005 is expected to be worth about $295 tomorrow theta can change as the options get closer to expiration for example options with a significant time premium eg those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches another thing to keep in mind theta is exponential not linear that means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration why is theta important time decay is an important concept in options trading theta is the metric that quantifies it so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes however remember that theta like all the greeks is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time on any given day supply and demand in the market will determine whether an options price rises or falls x200b 2321 theta 136 decay minus $136 per day current price $1083 per day x minus $136 $947 price tomorrow if nothing changes what is vega and how is it used vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract volatility can have a major impact on your options trade so vega can be important for assessing the riskreward profile of a given strategy the standard definition of vega is change in the option price percentagepoint change in implied volatility specifically vega represents the expected change in an options price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility for example if implied volatility rises from 23 to 24 a call option with a vega of 014 would be expected to rise in value by $014 why is vega important vega plays a critical role in determining the riskreward potential of a potential option trade if traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued they may look at vega to decide which options andor options strategies have the most profit potential 2321 vega 0534 for every 1 change in implied volatility iv $0534 per pointie 50 up would mean $0534 x 50 points $267 today was 3731 iv thats crazy volatility the 52week high for iv was 400 theres a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow $0534 x 400 3731 $2695 potential implied volatility for gamestop corporation current 3731 52wk avg 973 52wk high 4000 52wk low 331 x200b what is rho and how is it used rho measures an option contracts sensitivity to interest rate changes and is expressed as the expected change in an options value given a one percentage point change in interest rates the standard definition of rho is change in the option price percentagepoint change in interest rates how is rho used for example a call option with a rho of 002 would be expected to rise in value by $002 if interest rates rise from 2 to 3 rho can be positive or negative but has the strongest impact on longerterm options and is often considered less important than the other greeks by traders who focus on shorterterm options why is rho important in a lowinterest rate environment rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta vega gamma and theta still it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longerterm options positions x200b 2321 rho 0052 $0052 per 1 change in interest rate of borrowing sharesie if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19 to 29 10 points x 0052 $0052 extra to the option price x200b the summary for every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow the options price will increase 3513 based on case two case one iv is 1 and interest rate increases by 1 and common share price increases by $10 $219gamma theta vega rho total basic greeks $3493 $136 $0534 for every 1 move in iv $0052 for every 1 loan interest

$3493 $136 $0534 x 30 move in iv $162 $0052 for every 1 loan interest increase $052 $3805 current option premium price so per every $10 move in share price the analyzed option premium price increased $3805 or 3513 from last price on 2321 of $1083 x200b x200b tldr so per every $10 move in share pricethe analyzed option gamestop corporation 212 160c increases $3805 or 3513based upon case two with 30 iv increase and 10 interest rate increase x200b if there is continuous buying and hodling of shares and buying 25 call options and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers the options price will continue to rise 3513 every $10 increase in share price based upon case 2 and can be even more as iv goes higher or interest rate borrowing goes higher x200b what would happen to the 25 calls if the stock price rises every $10 exponential growth possibly and the final squoze the share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion even causing a halt on the way up x200b obligatory yolo positions x200b yolo 02032021 x200b i am not a financial advisor blah blah blah i like the stock and call option so i analyzed a particular call

96,15,2021-02-05 00:57:56,checkmate the next step for gme lots of new people in this sub and the posts are getting repetitive and way off track i want to share something meant to help redirect our focus in general during this insane rally the media has tried to script a narrative regarding what were all doing here and why were buying gme and that narrative is far from reality butwe are playing right into their hands with all of these us against them and im not selling i dont care if i lose my money style posts its actually killing us believe it or not why because that is exactly what the hedge funds want the public to believe this is simply a bunch of idiots trying to pump a dead stock in the hopes of taking down the shorts that narrative is perfect for the hfs because the masses sitting on the sidelines wondering if they should jump in are thinkingeh idk taking on hedge funds sounds like fun but these guys always win the stock just plummeted im not getting involved in that but ill root for em and the fact is that is not whats going on here at all we need to stop with the incessant us vs them posts thats not what we need at all is there an us vs them aspect 100 are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public without a doubt but the most powerful thing we can do what will ensure success not only for those currently invested but for those who join us in helping to bring gme back from the dead is we need to share our reasons for loving the company over and over constantly i didnt get into this play because of a short squeeze thats icing on the cake i got into this play because a savant ceo just took his world class ecommerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40b company in a few years and hes coming to gme to do it again i got into this play because gme now has ryan cohen and his crew along with amazons tech engineer as well as josh krueger who handled fulfillment for amazon walmart and qvc those companies have performed okay right it isnt very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 1850 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most chewycom destroyed amazon in their niche and thats saying something what happens to the stock price when rc comes out and starts to share his vision what happens when they name him ceo what happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential this is an amazing value stock i love it if its worth $800 in a few years it wouldnt surprise me in the least that all being said if we constantly post reasons for loving the company others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support its growth thats the heart of investing putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow this short squeeze fast cash fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative has to change its not helping anymore and in fact its hurting the company severely yes we want to expose lying cheating and manipulation and it wouldnt hurt to see rich greedy assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy who wouldnt want to see that but thats not why im supporting gme and i know its not why most are either we need to remember that and if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it thats not collusion its not organized trading its coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why you know what will stop that kind of momentum absolutley nothing and once the rest of the world sees what we see checkmate disclaimer this is not investment advice this is common sense make your own choices position 3610 shares at $143

105,22,2021-02-05 00:49:29,please stop creating false expectations and hold if you can afford to  tldr dont create false expectations dont post biased and unfounded analysis remain silent and hold stay retarded the beauty of all of this this subreddit in particular and this whole event in general is the fact that now more than ever the regular folk is looking at the stock market and curious about how it functions leading to a socialization and democratization of the fundamentals behind stock trading this is gamechanging and will definitely have a lasting impact that we have yet to behold but democratization does not mean instant comprehension what im trying to say is we can now access the knowledge it doesnt mean we have the knowledge nor that it will come easily or effortlessly stock market analysis is a very complex discipline even disregarding the fact that the system is absolutely rigged both in paper and in practice to favour the big fishes in detriment of the little investor there are still a lot of concepts and dynamics to grasp before one is able to make an accurate analysis michael burry didnt foresee a crack in the system by comparing two graphs and reading a news article he had studied the stock market for over a decade before being able to detect the housing market crisis even dfv did a fuckton of research before making his move and is also a financial analyst as far as i know what am i getting at with this that your biased unidimensional and rushed analysis guys i looked at one graph of the vw 08 squeeze and it looks exactly like gme today is the day is not helping anyone but the hedge funds why because you create false expectations which in turn affect morale and condition people to panicsell when said expectations are inevitably not met the bottomline is if you dont have anything productive and elaborated to say youd better remain silent and holding for everyones benefit but im not a financial advisor i barely can read and had to ask my dog to type this for me so dont take my word on it

425,28,2021-02-05 00:31:26,some updates on gme disclaimer i am not a professional and this is not investment advice i am long gme 216 shares cuz poor and ing this post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock it represents my personal opinion often backed up by facts but also including theorizing this is all in addition to the original ddupdates which can be viewed here one dd to rule them all further evidence that gamestop is serious about this they hired some big players with the focus on customer service and digital sales x200b 1 institutional ownership of gme is over 100 of the float blah blah blah whats the big deal well consider this for a moment if we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short which they can but not easilynot quicklythen every single share traded on the market is a shorted share that is owed to somebody thats right every single share traded on the market is actually an iou thats insane and for every share we as retail investors buy thats an additional iou i literally cant overstate how insane this is this isnt just a short squeeze where there arent enough sharesthere are literally less than zero unshorted shares traded this goes so far beyond a liquidity issue i honestly dont know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining gme shares anymore this thing will explode soon because every share bought is just compounding ious at this point on avg obviously forget the moon to some kind of permanent orbit 2 price movement during the meteoric rises on monday jan 25th we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement on tuesday jan 26th price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line this i believe was some shorts carefully slowly covering andor retail buying excitedly andor a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the friday before ended up being itm then between tuesday and wednesday price shot up afterhours from $150share to $350share bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx only $45m was needed for this price movement on wednesday jan 27th the stock essentially traded sideways with some big volatility then on thursday jan 28th many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy gme and the price fell sharply but then rose again with additional movement after hours likely mms covering the newly itm calls before friday perhaps some shorts covering on friday jan 29th a twitter account belonging to one kjetill stjerne who may or may not be a reclusive viking billionaire tweeted that they would hold the line in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like huntshortsells while nobody can confirm if this is true though he was for sure someone early on the gme boat we dont know if hes actually wealthy etc all of us who watched the level ii data stream on friday saw that many of the ladder attacks aka rapid share dumps andor shorts below ask price and sometimes below bid price were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days and the stock while very volatile closed at $325 essentially sideways movement again but with huge spikesdips leaving lots of call options itm after friday the stock dropped starting monday it closed monday at 225 and tuesday at 90 i believe this was due partially to people selling and panic selling but also due to people shorting its important to note that volume was highest during the friday before last and then last montue once the stock rose above $325 volume stayed relatively low and dropped until tuesday what does all this mean my opinion is that the spike was artificial someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements why i can handwave and give some optionsbut its all speculation and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while once that was evident brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares not just robinhood likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements thus locking out retail investors i personally also believe the viking was legit and hes the reason the price stayed up on friday in the absence of retail buying but thats my personal opinion which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions 3 broker restrictions it is critical to note thisinterview this chairman of ibkr one of the brokers said this we are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems through the onslaught of orders to continue to provide liquidity and we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses in other words there were so many shares of gme traded that it seems they were having trouble to find the shares andor the cash to backup trades he also talked about how he saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses so brokers began to call margins on margin accounts liquidating stock and options sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip etoro accidentally set automatic stoplimits robinhood restricted buying to one share etc etc all of which led to a drying up of the buy side of the books allowing the sell side to push price down far more easily than normal 4 media manipulation it has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation whether willfully or not from articles about the short squeeze in nok or bb neither of which is significantly shorted to an endless litany of articles about how reddit or the reddit army has moved to silver despite only a single post in the sub about it or biotech etc the silver one is my favorite because everyone reported thatbut it was practically absent from this sub smells really fishy ever since wed jan 13th the media has been reporting that the short squeeze has happened the best examples in my opinion is if you watch the new articles after doing a google search of gme youll find that in general whenever gme starts to rise there are suddenly new not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now articles bashing on gamestop retail traders the frenzy wsb or speculation in general my personal opinion based on what ive seen 5 bot accounts theres been a massive influx in this sub of bot accounts that seem to generally be negative on the gme situation x200b these are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like its still worth holding gme if the news article writers tried harder to find the truth please dm me ill help instead of blatantly making things up re silver squeeze nok squeeze bb squeeze other next targets of reddit qanon comparisons etc if citadel a market maker didnt give a loan to melvin a huge gme shorter if citron research hadnt tweeted on jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting gme the next day just as gme dipped suddenly during a rise and then postponed it because they forgot about the inaugurationand proceeded to give really unconvincing reasons if people didnt see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts if the price movements werent extremely suspect and rapid if there wasnt constant reporting about shorts have definitely already covered for weeks if we hadnt seen hundreds of articles about how wsb traders could never understand the fundamentals while ive seen more fundamentals in the dds here than in any news article about gme if brokers almost across the board hadnt suddenly restricted the ability for retail investors to buy but not sell shares andor options if institutional ownership wasnt over 100 and shorters hadnt been so greedy as to short up to 138 of float its lower now but its still insanely high imo and finally if there wasnt a convincing turnaround story and evidence of it then people including myself wouldnt be holding this is my summary of what i feel are the pertinent points relating to gme atm feel free to buy sell hold the stock as you see fit this is not financial advice dont ever buy stockoptions with money you cant afford to lose
0,23,2021-02-05 00:24:37,gme could find its place to all the peoples still holding chances of it going to 400 again soon are slim however amazons game business is failing the real hope for any of us holding is amazon buying a cheap game distributor like gme to beef up the brand they have renewed brand loyalty too thanks to this so it makes it an attractive buy for a large company trying to create a loyal base in a suffering business of theirs well a fella can hope either way and such to the moon this is not financial advice and i am not a financial advisor
14,15,2021-02-05 00:24:08,is holding the line enough im not someone who was introduced to investing or wsb from the gme craze but i have never been more than a lurker until now i have been watching this battle from the sidelines since the beginning of the month and after seeing all the trading restrictions going on last week i decided to buy the dip on principle with that said the powers that be have managed to drive the price down and even though gme at 90100 is still a huge difference from where it was at the start of the year its a far cry from the highs it was driven to i have no actual facts to support this but i would have to imagine the institutions that were short gme at 20 have taken advantage of the dips to get out of those positions and that plenty of institutions were happy to open new short positions when it was pushing 300 if that happens to be the case arent those shorts already extremely profitable and not threatened to close that position whatsoever if the price were to plateau would a true autist bless me with an explanation of how holding the line here can still force a squeeze in a battle of attrition
0,19,2021-02-05 00:20:37,why buy gme now can you retards explain to me why anyone should be buying and holding gme at such an inflated price before you tards drove the price up it never traded over $32 in the last 5 years and its obviously heading right back there

67,13,2021-02-04 23:19:57,weaklings among us do you know what i think about when i see weak ass paper hands little shitters talking about oh no robinhood really wasnt at fault here it was just liquidity hedge funds arent stupid they could have covered multiple times over all that volume there is no conspiracy etc etc when i hear that i think of the people who defended the catholic church over child abuse scandals those who bought into pharmaceutical company propaganda and those who defends some prominent politicians whom i shall not name over certain things in general brainless twats where there is motive for profit or the prevention of loss thereof there is action i dont know what rh did behind the doors but i know they are motivated to do what they did i dont know what tactics hfs have or have not used but i know they are motivated sec fuckers are also motivated bc they always have been so i am gonna believe that rh and vlad tenev and the hedge funds conspired to bring down gme i am gonna believe that sec and yellen are getting their big paydays by wall street just because i cant pinpoint a specific evidence doesnt mean that jack shit our courts have put people away for less my beliefs may not be exactly true but they are certainly closer to truth than believing that rh hfs sec and interested parties didnt do anything illegal just because there is yet concrete evidence so hold those fucking gme shares because i know those fuckers want them so bad that they will do anything to take it off your hands get some post nut clarity to help your fud brains diamond fucking hands

91,26,2021-02-04 23:04:56,lets get real here were all retards but were selfaware retards we make our own decisions because a is a b is b and gme is just because someone hypes up a stock doesnt mean that you should invest its always up to you and the amount of time youre willing to spend researching the stock i know thats not what wsb initially stood for most of us just came here for the loss gain porn but now that the attention of sec media and hedge funds has been drawn onto us its important to differentiate hype and rational critical thinking none of us here buys stocks because someone tells us to do so we make our own fucking choices and we accept the losses and welcome the gains regarding the current situation based on informative posts and comments ive had the pleasure of reading it looks like its going to be a long and weary battle but at the end of the day what differentiates you from a paper handed bitch and a legitimate retard are the reasons behind your investing decisions do you really believe that gme is an undervalued company in general do you believe that gme has the potential to expand into something truly beautiful and magnificent especially after all the traction the companys been having over the course of last month do you trust the company if you do then youve got nothing to worry about even if the stock price dips to $5060 investings never about making a quick buck sure there are those who get lucky every now and then but if you invest with the i make quick gains mindset chances are youll lose because youre investing in a highly volatile unpredictable market that has a history of crashing at the slightest of inconveniences tdlr invest in shit you actually believe in and hold positions 105 shares of gme $193 80 shares of bb $185 11 shares of vtv therapeutics $288
6,52,2021-02-04 23:04:14,when where can i find the next gme short count  need some help gorilla gang i dont know what the fuck is going on anymore i just cant bring myself to believe shorts are all or even mostly covered when does the short percentage of gme get posted whats the source pos 50$126 ps does anyone have a compiled dd of the last two weeks shits got crazy af not financial advice

21,19,2021-02-04 22:56:04,lowquality dd with thoughts about situation future exit and my impression of the whole war this text will be emoji free i wont tell everyone to hold to moon and shit even though this might be the way or not x200b i current situation as all people here obviously noted there is a war going on between hedge funds retail investors and other people in the background including media reddit celebrities everyone has their play everyone wants money fame leverage whatever there is a split here in reddit some just want gainz some want to keep the movement going and some kinda want both x200b fyi im neither im not invested in gme or anything else as a matter of fact im a stock virgin im a pretty high earning not 1 high but i get a fucking good salary for my age and this will only rise so im not in financial danger in any way but i have close relationship to my money in terms of not losing it i wanted to buy gme but at any given point except last wednesday i was looking at dangerous numbers either too volatile for me to get in or going down x200b ii what we really know we know hedge funds shorted gme and others we dont know from where exactly we dont know exactly when and as a matter of fact we dont know how much all the data we have is either outdated not a good source or just flat wrong si might sit at 200 right now that would tell us nothing those could be shorts started at 300 and hedges want to earn even more those could be shorts started at 20 90 or 180$ x200b at this moment even si is not helping us making decisions even if we would know the true number we know the stock is very volatile right now we dont really know why short ladder attacks are a myth i hope this is cleared by now x200b what is obvious is that there is market manipulation manipulation derives from latin manus meaning by hand that is for sure we know hedge funds and even us change the stock price by hand somehow if it is by buying holding selling shorting fake news true news whatever x200b iii what does that all mean now it means the short squeeze could already be over it could mean we are in it but it was heavily fought against by any means including unfair ones it could mean squeeze is still in the future waiting x200b what it means for the stock it will stay volatile it might stay at 90$ for some time as long as retailes still buy in and maybe even other hedge funds or whales it might drop it might even rise maybe hedge funds bought in right now and want to keep the momentum upward and sell at a specific point crushing the price with retailers beeing the bagholders what does it mean for us retailers its dangerous to invest into this stock nothing is safe diamond handing this could end in gme dropping to 20$ again and this might stay the case for a long time it might work and stock price goes into 1000$ x200b iv whom are we fighting it is important to note that we are fighting a multibillion dollar cartel of people who are deep into the stockmarket since beginning of stock trading basically they know every trick and more do you guys really think they have no idea how to fight retailers they might do ladder attacks because they shorted the stock again and now stop just to buy into gme they might want us all to hold just so the price rises until exactly 299$ when they will sell 10mm shares and price drops to 90$ again they might want to ride the rocket to the moon too they might want the whole stock to drop to 10$ who knows x200b it is important to know that they analyse this whole sitation and make their own plan x200b v what is the danger here x200b this is a reddit we are 85mm degenerates on this sub and latest after last week hedge funds are monitoring this so what is the problem if reddit is monitored they might even use this for example they know a ton of people will cling to this stock with their life not even thinking about selling if it is 98 down i have no fucking clue what a good trader could do with this info but im betting it is dangerous for the people on here invested in gme x200b vi what shall we do what is the future x200b i have no fucking clue personally if i already had invested in gme there would be 2 possible situations i got in below todays market price for example like all those guys with 10k shares at 20$ they are still hugely in the green i personally would propably have secured some cash at 400$ but i would definitly secure some cash now depending how much im in i would keep at least a good portion of the stock in hopes in goes moon x200b if i got in above todays market price lets say at 150 i would think about getting out anytime the stocks goes above 100$ again and try to minimise my loss if the money is a lot for me or i need it x200b if it is gamble money i would stay invested but would be pessimistic enough to not hope for rocketfuel vii what if the rocket goes moon when do i sell a false impression that was created here is that everyone at any point buying into gme would make tons of tendies that is wrong usually in situations like this early adopters make tons of tendies dfv for example or anyone who got in at 20$ dollar range then at some point lets say stock price hits 1000$ now what happens if everyone and their mother sells at exactly that point first 10000 sellers get their 1000$ price but pretty fast price drops immensly this will end in a downward spiral see vw short squeeze graph with tons of people not making huge bank or even lose money if they got in late think 300$ range and sell the last x200b so what could be an exit strat be i would say the later you got in the earlier you sell that makes sure you exit in the green and not accidentally in the red i wont sell at 350 if i got in at 300 but i wouldnt wait out a mass selloff and then might drop under 200$ and still lose money after i tripled my money x200b last words from a stock virgin and tldr this whole story is crazy and cool and i hope all of ya earn tons of tendies but pls for the love of god if stock raises again and you see overall black numbers and this is your fucking retirement money get it fucking back and cash out this is not a game this whole dream of becoming a rich tendie ape is not worth beeing homeless because stocks treat retailers like bitches this whole thing might work out but youre against a multibillion dollar cartel that does everything to make money or keep money they shit on every rule just to stay on top dont risk your lifes savings on the hunch they might play by the book
761,26,2021-02-04 22:53:43,at market open im selling my car to buy a bigly amount of lambos with the tendies im going to get from gme this is not financial advice im just a retarded talking shit on the internet ps melvin pps heres an excessive amount of rocket emojis 
138,32,2021-02-04 22:49:07,lets see if i can post on my cake day about gme id like to give words of encouragement to all my ape brethren and sisters gotta be inclusive cause that article called us sexists ive seen so many uplifting stories over these past two weeks i got in a little late avg 170 for 4 shares but last week that dude talked about feeling alive since his wifes passing another guy talked about experiencing homelessness people have bought switches for kids in hospitals and donated to charity this isnt a meme anymore together we are helping to make better lives for one another we have found a common purpose in gme and i feel like that is one of the main goals for every ape in their life im still holding and i dont care if i lose all my fucking money but after reading countless discussion threads and dd i truthfully believe were going to the moon so long as we stick together ive tried to explain to my friends who arent involved in our struggle about whats going on here and they just cant comprehend it that a bunch of people on the internet care about one another to the point of facing potential financial loss i trust you guys and girls and know that you trust me too thats what i think makes this so special thank you all for the laughs and the ups and downs and the joyous feeling of smashing in all caps on the keyboard about being an autist are forever and i will stay with you all till the moon tldr i love you all and im not fucking leaving together strong

599,58,2021-02-04 22:40:27,nothing matters at this point just hold and wait youll get your tendies soon  news articles saying squeeze is over doesnt matter its fake s3 short interest data doesnt matter its fake all the naysayers are just paper handing bitches ignore them the price went down for 3 days in a row it literally doesnt matter the price could go to $1 it literally wouldnt matter as long as we dont sell they cant close their short positions hell even delisting gme wouldnt matter at this point we would just hold low volume doesnt matter weve seen this before although high volume is usually an indicator that a squeeze is happening in this case its just melvin fucking with us and playing psychological warfare theyre trying to make it more and more difficult to hold and make us feel more and more stupid for not just giving in but its exactly what they want go for a walk if you cant look at the price of the stock this is a new paradigm it literally doesnt matter at this point because of the fundamentals stay strong youll get your tendies soon at this point were like jonestown just financially rather than physically 426 shares of gme bought at $32765 not selling for less than $10k

0,36,2021-02-04 19:36:47,100 si is not conclusive proof of naked shorting heres why im fucking broke because i bought gme at $350 and on tuesday this means that when i run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more i go get a grand from a payday lender there is now $1000 of debt owned by the payday lender and $1000 of cash owned by me the day after i take out my loan my cousin dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down he shorted gme at $5 during the summer so hes even more broke than i am since im a sap i loan him enough to get it fixed say $500 remember im broke too so that $500 comes out of the $1000 i got from the payday lender heres the important part there is still only $1000 of cash $500 owned by dan $500 by me but the amount of debt has gone up to $1500 $500 owned by me and the original $1000 owned by the payday lender this is not illegal or even against the rules to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls so i have a strong incentive to get up dans ass about his sharebut at the end of the day thats a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldnt give a shit shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again this makes it possible for a stock to have in theory infinity si without a single naked short existing do naked shorts of gme probably exist anyway if the failtodeliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate i would lean strongly towards yes is it still retarded to short a stock 100 of float and will that probably produce a short squeeze also yes does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if its not naked yes but none of those mean you should go around stating gmes si real theoretical or historical as any kind of proof that its been shorted naked get better evidence and know what youre talking about

93,212,2021-02-04 18:40:44,guys i feel sick put everything i had $900 in hope of a little life changing moment feel cheated by criminal manipulation tactics from hedge funds ive been debating to post this or not but i feel sharing it and writing this down will help ive been really depressed for months and always have suicidal thoughts throughout my life and last week i was feeling very low and heard of all this gme and the positivity of it all and down with it i was in need of a little happiness and good fortune while helping others at the same time i dont have a lot but i put in everything i had $100 338 and then $400 330 to hold for a longtime and then bought more the money i needed to live on to try cover my loss as i thought it would go up within a few days i own 328 shares with a $650 loss starting with $900 but its now looking like i will have to sell everything at about $90 as im completely out of money and in debt i feel sick cheated and now even more broke and broken its not right the criminal activity and manipulation of the hedge funds lowering the value of the shares the incorrect information and lies from mainstream media and manipulation to drive people not to buy resulting in the share value going down restricting free trade by many trading apps not allowing people to buy and only sell hugely impacting the value by causing panic and mass selling resulting in the value of shares going down where is the justice and hope for the small people if we are restricted from fair trade hope it rockets after im out you all make life changing gains if i wasnt in debt and broke i would hold edit i know it was completely my mistake putting the money i needed in and the blame is completely my own and i will suffer because of that ive never gambled before but then we could say everything we do in life is a gamble but i thought of it as a investment to hold and something to actually own 900 is a lot for me as i currently dont work due to my mental health im a ex soldier and 33 i did do my research and wouldnt say im dumb just a very bad stupid decision after the money i was going to hold with maybe my mental health played apart of that or i was just not thinking in the moment thanks for the positive comments and messages from others that have suffered also and thanks for constructive criticism it helps also to all the ppl telling me to hold out longer i wish i could screenshot

30,61,2021-02-04 18:32:54,what sets a 1000$ gme ticker what stops everyone from just trading gme at 1000 or rather what specifically sets the ticker to 1000 i dont really understand how a demand for a specific price of a stock is reached by consensus from individuals who cant decide on anything thanks for answering my dumb question even though i cant appear to see any of the replies on my phonei guess set your limit sales at 1000$ if that is the goal so ive done my part buy set limit at 1k and walk away the synopsis was pretty much what is to be expected supply and demand but the supply is below a demand of 1000 there just needs to be less supply below 1000$ i was told there was supposed to be blackjack here i think it goes without saying im not a financial advisor and if i were yours 
21,46,2021-02-04 18:28:56,gamestop is it possible that an enormous options program for employees and new exec hires is what we see if i was the dictator of gamestop i guess that means ryan cohen i would buy millions and millions of far otm calls $800 and shower employees with these as part of the compensation package for a strategic transformation combined with some vesting schedule like perhaps 3 years where the contract is void if they leave the company if i was sitting on shorty mc shorts this would scare the hell out or me the next step would then be to slowly and steadily release news about the new strategy one little piece at a time a few days apart for a very very long time together with a charming communication strategy which rally employees fans of the company and us who like the stock you are recommended and more than welcome to belong to all three of these categories if you ask me we like the stock in the middle of this rallying movement also bring on the news about rc himself increasing his position towards 1999 in several small batches so those news can hit outlets and the street in a flow beneath all this there are us in gme gang old and new members with diamond hands and conviction apes togeher also keep up the relentless vigilante billboard campaign in the long run this kind of movement is supporting the chances of an epic turnaround to succeed imagine going to work at your local gamestop store in the morning and you see one of these beauties i would be inspired to stick around and do my best this entire event around the short squeeze the politics the story has put the brand on the radar of the entire world in a way rarely seen it is value in itself to be added to the fundamentals of the company if i wanted to buy a brand awareness campaign for the company i work at we would need to fork up more money than the gamestop current market cap not kidding gamestop like a phoenix rises from the smoldering ruins of its own history this is my prediction and it is one demanding patience now you shoot this down what in my prediction is wrong is there a better way to go about it are there some legal constraints preventing this type of operation or something have at it and bring my little ego back to earth pos 1450 $gme paper handed some doh had to reduce my exposure from 4350 to be able to stay on this tiger without constant fear of having made a huge mistake as i was 95 in which was bad for my weak brain
0,18,2021-02-04 18:16:23,to all the people who think gme naysayers are bots you guzzled that koolaid like ur wife guzzles her boyfriends cum if u want the perspective of proper wsb retards and not that of the fresh even more retarded meat go and peruse the profiles of parties involved in the gme posts months ago could do it via deepfuckingvalues account and just as a general rule in life look to the people who get in on things early and spoke accurately to the future in the past rather than just riding the waves of hysteria and groupthink that are shat out in the thick of it btw any reasonable tard figured dfv was never selling i have no positions in gme and no opinions on its fair valuation
136,64,2021-02-04 17:40:49,im not going to tell you to hold or sell but i will tell you to do your research please just do some deep diving into why gme is a good stock to hold i know most of you saw some wsb posts show up in rall and thought you could get in while the iron was hot newsflash most of the people you know use reddit and they werent dumb enough to put money into it after it had already increased $300 in two weeks newsflash 2 you were dumb enough thats fine as long as you have real reasons to back up your actions instead of spamming the daily chat with super unique phrases like here we go or guh please just put some time into researching this stock not only will you learn something you will be able to explain why you did something so retarded the smart people in this sub care about you we dont want to see you lose hundredsthousands of dollars holding works for the people who can afford it if you cant afford it then you better learn about this situation and be able to back up your actions
58,27,2021-02-04 17:38:46,not a loss until you sell applies most of the time but always depends on the stock ive been on this subreddit since 2017 and only started posting during this gme runup given the amount of hype that gme was getting i feel like i need to say something so people dont $rope thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze i need people to understand that not selling depending on the stock is also losing because of oppurtunity cost i am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you but i see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3$25 per share for the last 4 years yes i understand cohen can make changes to make gme a successful businesses but understand it can take years if you bought at 300500 you will basically need a short squeeze to get out of those positions if your paper loss is already 75 than ya probably just hold but do what is best for you the heavy realized loss that i took from my last gme trade hurt a lot but i took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already ba and msft sometimes you need to be proactive and not waitpray for a short squeeze to happen for example if i have a position in aapl and for whatever reason it drops 30 i wont sell it since i know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of aapls fundamentals people need to understand that gme was a high risk high reward play if you believe that this stock was manipulated then what makes you think they will stop now if you are confident in your position then hold i pray that a short squeeze does happen since i sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for you

484,65,2021-02-04 17:17:06,technically i am a financial advisor im not going to give you advice though personally i own 8 shares of gme at 270 i cant get out even if i wanted to now my only option is to hold until earnings and some type of action from cohen shorts will likely exit at some point but you know my money is going to be tied up for a while i might buy some more in this huge dip to lower my average cost in any case i dont bet what i cant lose but unless gme goes to 0 odds are i wont lose some day i may paper hands but not now tldr im going to hold and buy dips
523,50,2021-02-04 16:57:25,we stopped a company from going bankrupt not sure what will happen to gme i hope for the best because you guys really deserve it i only hold 2 shares but that only came about from the passion i saw on here in wanting to stick it to wall street each and everyday i read something that just shows how blatantly corrupt these hedge funds and news networks are and yet were the bad guys were the idiots the losers who risked it all to take on the big guys and failed but im proud nonetheless i am in no saying that i think this is over yet but just remember that our individual and in no corroborated actions helped a company avoid bankruptcy we stopped a company that was being condemned to death i dont know what gamestop could be doing right now but theyre idiots if theyre not using this rise in popularity to raise capital or begin the move to online commerce thats at least how i see it thats how this movie ends for now

812,86,2021-02-04 16:52:58,simple explanation of why im still holding 530 shares of gme i just join wsb last week and im happy to be with you retards on this journey as a fellow retard im not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street i know enough to understand what is going on but ive always stayed away from shorting margin or options so honestly my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks itmotm contracts and naked shorts im sure the 6 million new subscribers feel the same way so im going to break down in super simple terms why im still holding the stock first though its important to face reality this movement to take on the hedge funds has died down wsb was getting over 1 million new subscribers per day and now its only gaining maybe 100000 subscribers the google trend data for gme stock shows significantly less traffic x200b also a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of gme there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze but im still not selling why ill break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do according to yahoo finance there are 47 million shares in the public float meaning shares available for the public to trade x200b x200b there are 85 million subscribers on wsb if each subscriber held an average of 55 shares wsb would control the entire float if the entire float was owned by wsb then wsb would literally control the price of the stock yes i know that not all 85 million subscribers are going to buy gme and even if wsb did a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early also many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots but lets pretend that just 25 have diamond hands and buy gme that would mean there would be 2125 million people buying the stock if 25 each bought an average of 22 shares wsb would control the entire float 2125 million x 22 4675 million this is definitely possible although not probable given the recent developments however the risk vs reward is still very lucrative i created a probability table and assigned a probability of gme hitting certain prices x200b according to my table i estimate that the probability that gme will go to $75 or less at 73 however in the event that wsb controls the shares of gme the price would skyrocket it doesnt matter if the short interest is at 100 50 or 25 there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply i believe im being very conservative with my estimates on the upside i assign a 27 chance that the price of the stock would go to $150 or more out of the 27 i only give a 1 chance that the price will go to 2000 if you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price you get a weighted average price of $182 given the current price of $89 that would represent a 104 return to be clear i am in no way telling wsb to buy gme in order to gain control of the price im just saying if wsb happens to control it the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price but what do i know im just a monkey ape retard idiot autist blah blah blah position 530 gme $98
101,47,2021-02-04 16:34:11,request for dd on actually liking the stock $gme this is all new to me my husband and my boyfriend are a finance dude but many of the questions ive asked have stretched their knowledge on the matter especially on this stock which has more to do with psychological warfare than with the fword fundamentals after today and the announcements from gamestop it got me wondering first i know that at some point game stop repurchased a bunch of their own shares they knew something before most did and that was that they were putting some real money and effort behind amping up their image and offering i heard they closed down locations did a salelease deal with their warehouse locations and even sold off the firms jet just in order to buy more of their own stock so theyre invested just like we are into the price of this stock i believe that because theyre invested like us theyre likely to work on a strategy that would be beneficial to all of us as well i know we cant compare ourselves to the vw squeeze we lack the element of surprise and an instant lack of stocks to purchase the same way they did however what are the mechanics of if some other company came in and announced that they werehad bought in to gme could they have done this already without our knowing what would they have to do if they wanted to just seems like a decent play and im trying to learn more about how this shit works what other possible plays could gamestop make which would be good for them but also good for us do other hedge funds have a benefit if they were to disclose their positions if this is a war of ownership it just seems like it would be beneficial to all parties involved and boughtin to disclose positions so that we look like a united front combine that with some other large buy from an interested party and that could be huge right after hearing about the possibility of a streaming service to compete with twitch i became interested in actually going long with gme even at $325 not only that but i feel like gamestop will go forward with the feeling of we need to justify all the faith put into us i cant imagine another company that would feel as much obliged to the approval of their share holders than gamestop can you imagine the necessity to deliver that board must feel they ought to just thoughts from a baby ape its been fun getting involved with the sub im constantly hearing my boyfriend and husband talk about when theyre jerking each other off thanks for humoring an annoying noob at the very least ill always know that im not a fucking paper hands bitch ftr in the week since ive put $25k into gme ive gotten another $65k in payments in real life there are real life lessons to be learned from not being a paper hands bitch im a better ballsier businesswoman after this week i love hanging out with you fucking retards and im looking forward to posting many future lossgain porns which will be completely unrelated to gme edit wtf is going on with the sub im getting emails about comments which are not showing up
38,22,2021-02-04 16:21:05,serious question about s3 short interest data let me start by saying i am not a paper handed bitch and will be holding my 10 gme shares $128 till im both retarded and dead i am idiot and 5 beers deep but i have seen several posts from people saying that s3 had recently changed their short float formula to hide things they are referencing traditional si float figures and the new s3 si float figures saying this s3 si figure is a new or recently changed formula but im looking at tweets from s3 as far back as october here where they have been mentioning the s3 si float this whole time based on what im seeing am i too retarded to understand this or have people been lying about the formula changing im still holding either way just trying to get to the bottom of this fuck
70,41,2021-02-04 15:47:51,gme speculation price may drop to the $6030 range before the squeeze is squoze im retarded so dont take this as financial advice but based on the current gme pattern looks like well see a small spike during the thursday premarket and itll then drop into the $6030 range by the end of the day on friday the pattern will tighten up and well likely see either $gme fall to oblivion or a big ass spike by monday idk if the spike will be the squeeze but itll be big the number of puts expiring and past volume supports this theory and robinhood increased allowed share purchases to $500 which should make it possible for more apes to buy the dip and drive the squeeze x200b we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent x200b im holding till this goes to $0 or $10000
0,39,2021-02-04 15:43:40,the new gme game plan puts buy puts and more puts sell all your shit and make money on the way back down duh  so here is a way for all the retarded apes to get down from the top of the redwood everyone first of all just understand that stocks dont actually only go up they can go down too and guess what unlike cryptocurrency you can buy these things called puts which allow you to make money when a stock goes down so here is the plan 1 sell all your shares and calls why the upward momentum was killed look at your fucking chart you stupid dumbfucking retard 2 we create downward momentum and selling pressure from selling why you will stop losing money and just lock in whatever you have left why because we are going to reinvest ourselves into a new opportunity once everyone has stopped being stupid and minimized their never ending loss the stock will just plummet instead of this retarded flat movement that makes no money for anyone 3 we invest everything into deep otm puts expiring this week or next week expiration if we made the stock go up we can make it go down and profit so sell your shit and buy puts so we all make moon money positions 100 contracts of 25 expiration 30$ puts 4 profit from puts they fucked us already its over so get over it and learn how to still make money from this situation buy puts and sell make money you can still moon and diamond hand puts so once again gme puts any strike any fucking expiration
3320,294,2021-02-04 15:43:12,do not sell why gme is going to $1000 next week first of all if you are reading this post and do not own any gme stock go and buy some right now ok now that that is taken care of i have done some thinking and have discovered some interesting things i will list 3 reasons why gme is not over and why this is actually going to shoot to new records this week or next week tldr gme is going to 8001000 by next week because all the bitch paper handers are out there is also a possibility of a second short squeeze happening any day now x200b the other day when gme fell 60 the volume for that day did not even pass the average daily volume yes let me repeat that when the stock went down 60 there was so little amount of sellers we did not even pass the daily volume this means that the people who are paper hand bitches have already sold because if gme goes down 60 and you havent sold good news for you you are a diamond hand baller now this leads to my second point x200b so that the only people left holding gme are the diamond hand chads it will be really hard to get us to sell if anything this dip has been a blessing to allow us to grab more stock at cheap we have held the ground of around $100 or a good 2 days if you do not know gme was way below that at the beginning of its new found value the short percentage is still super high even though the old shorts may be out there are now new shorts that think this thing is going back down but once they realize that wont happen they will stop risking it and just buy back the stock now this is what can kickstart the next short squeeze which i think can easily go to 8001000 x200b now if those two reasons werent good enough gamestop has hired new executives and professionals to the company from very successful companies this means that they are not letting this opportunity go to waste and make some money from it and remember a company is worth however much the people who buy the stock believe it is worth at
99,8,2021-02-04 15:40:11,remember remember  remember remember the 4th of febtember the gmepowder treason and plot i know of no reason not to hold through the season to the moon or lest gme be forgot

0,10,2021-02-04 15:13:43,what i think is happening w gme is that the shorts have already made their money i dont know nothing about nothing but everyday we get these crazy swings where gme hits sub $90 for a bit then goes up to mid $120 what if the shorts were able to source together more money so that they buy those dips in large amounts and sell at the top then do some market stuff short ladder straight trading etc to make the price go down like what if theyre all in on us and just take turns making money on those trades its like theyre messing with us and profiting off these dips and purposely keeping it within reach to give us a glimpse of hope idk just my two

6,14,2021-02-04 14:53:42,will brokersdealers be ever forced to deliver shares im wondering if anyone in finance can tell me this it seems pretty much 100 evident there was a lot of naked short selling on gme this isnt even up for dispute at this time question is will they ever be forced to deliver the shares or can they delay indefinitely seems to me if there is any force to deliver lots of brokers will be screwed but if not then all you guys holding are screwed so its really down to sec enforcing this edit what if all longs request a physical stock certificate from gamestop will that have any effect

6,6,2021-02-04 14:31:55,apha shareholder vote date hello retards fucktards wives boyfriends made some nice tendies in last 2 weeks off gme and nakd plays now in apha for an options play positions apha $19c 219 which i may even roll further out tbd im bullish at the very least on the runup to the merger expected in q2 source however i realize this is ultimately subject to shareholder vote given that the reverse merger is architected to prevent dilution of existing shares i dont expect it not to pass even so i cant seem to find anything that indicates when exactly that vote is expected except this statement from apha websites merger faq page do i get to vote on the transaction yes you will have a chance to vote on the transaction at a meeting of shareholders the transaction must be approved by at least twothirds of the votes cast by aphria shareholders full details of the transaction will be included in a management information circular of aphria to be mailed to aphria shareholders in the coming weeks obviously this passing would ensure myself and other apha bulls dont get rugpulled and perhaps might even lift the stock since so many here probably havent priced it eg recent influx of newbies has anyone received this yet if so what datetime does the vote take place thanks and inb4 ill go fuck myself in advance

23,9,2021-02-04 14:27:40,gme long even without a squeeze many were maybe looking for the mother of all short squeezes when they yolod gme many others just like the stock maybe plenty of us are true believers in a long play at gme some just boarded the hype train now that were all together in this i wanted to open this thread up so peeps to share why they like the stock maybe yall have ideas of how to solve one or more issues holding gme back heck maybe via proxy power we have the ability to add pressure and get some shit done more likely ive strained my only remaining brain cell but eh its probably fine as a former frontline grunt employee with gme i know the customer base is broad and the core audience is heavily invested there is an enduring emotional investment in the retailer and a strong brand recognition as a household name love and hate are both passionate possitions and that strong reaction to the brand name speaks to a unique positioning and strong potential ability to connect with the growing subcultures surrounding and supporting the brand to date im still not sure about sherman but im completely thrilled to have fresh relevant and diverse faces on the board especially cohen and reggie to forge a better place in this space for gme over time gme has good cash flow access to hard to get ip licenses and solid relationships with vendor partners but has struggled to find the brand identity and experience that could put it in the rabidfanboyfangirlnongenderconformingfanperson level of companies in the broader ecosystem like amd sony nintendo insert your favorite game developerpublisher imagine if rather than we make technology affordable and simple gme evolved its experience to become a holy church for gamers and gaming culture like the nyc nintendo store or many apple stores it wouldnt take much imho the frontline staffs passion for the brand is already uniquely positioned for this to the point where ive heard many minimum wage earning employees tell me that it was their childhood dream job embrace that expand it thats where i see the companys opportunity to move from a finite game ideology to an infinite game mentality credit simon sinek that is not so different from what reggie helped to build and grow at nintendo of america add that to cohen being able to turn up the volume online via omnichannel and every storefront already being a mini distribution center add some level of profit sharing being announced with digital sales for this new console cycle squeeze or not i like the stock tldr i like the stock share why you like the stock edit im a novice learning some shit and having fun there is plenty of good dd but it is not here this is an opinion an not financial advice

34,14,2021-02-04 14:21:26,newbies heres why you should hold onto shares you bought squeeze or no squeeze sorry if this was supposed to be posted somewhere else or with a different flair tldr investing costs money and you probably would have smooth or your first trade anyways use this opportunity and motivation to learn more about trading and about companies you believe in do you research everyone here will tell you if youre retarded or theyre retarded coughdfvcough and one day you might be swimming in a pool of tendies like many of you newbies i bought in to the hype around gme around the peak i believe that if robinhood hadnt restricted trading the squeeze would have already happened but thats besides the point right now investing is a complicated game and thats really what it is on this side of the money a game you have no control of over what happens to your money after you put it in the slot the company will do as it will and you just hope you get some green instead of red heres the squeeze investing has a cost of entry no matter when you got in the game you would have had to pay a price and your subject to the same swings as everybody else on the market and every other smooth brained retard or autist every investor has lost money at some point be it on paper or realized not every investment works out and if youre new it can be discouraging to have your first attempt blow up in your face but you paid the cost of entry you opened an account and started trading and the next trade might go differently learn about options learn about margin learn how to read all of those fancy graphs that your broker offers you read up on what a company is doing and how its performing year over year and against its competitors come over here and pitch us on it with a well thought out dd include for the retards use this opportunity to transform into an autist like some beautiful retarded butterfly that made a chrysalis out of loss porn and memes grow your knowledge as an investor and take another chance invest in what you believe is going to succeed or if youre still too retarded for that read a dd someone else made if youre confident yolo it odds are someone else will do it too then you can either eat tendies or stand in line at the food bank together and thats what wsb is about being retarded together and making or losing a shit ton of money x200b and remember even a retarded gorilla picks the right stock twice a day x200b x200b edit or buy becuase you like the stock that works too
27,8,2021-02-04 14:14:14,wsb isnt about collectively buying and selling look gme got many excited i got them but this is not a place for people to post lets all buy xxx stock now if this is what you think wsb is about you havent been here long enough
35,16,2021-02-04 14:12:34,do you hear me elon if elon buys gme we all should buy at least 1 tesla i think gme can provide offline infra for charging station high speed internet along with starlin for tesla owners not only that but also while being charged tesla owners shop and play games watch movies and all inside their tesla new cto also can enhance this business more efficiently and efficiently i truly feel the potential growth of gme in the future and have learnt the power of our community since joining i like gamestop
23,68,2021-02-04 14:11:33,60 i feel like a true fucking retard i would post the screenshot but its not letting my upload to imgur nevertheless down 60 on gme and i feel like a fucking loser invested most of my savings of like $4k and now it feels like i got hit by a car shit fucking sucks whatever man this shit just wasnt meant to be for me props to everyone who profited and congrats idk if i should just sell what i have left and take my loss like a retard that i am or hold and hope to god
0,18,2021-02-04 14:10:57,lets make sellas life sciences $sls the next gme as i see it $sls is hugely undervalued currently due to a massive amount of shorting the company is doing amazing work in the fight against cancer specifically in regards to leukemia for example their antileukemic therapy gps showed a median overall survival of 21 months vs the 54 months survival that is currently available phase 2 study that is incredible and i cant think of a better company to support than a company that is fighting cancer which affects everyone they also signed an exclusive license agreement with china to commercialize gps and the next generation gps across all of china potentially $202m in licensing not including future royalties if you want to learn more you can take a look at this dd on reddit also there is definitely something going on here beneath the surface because today feb 3 the stock was up $122 with no news being released for some reason news outlets have been saying that the uptick is due to reddit but i didnt find many threads that got a lot of attention potentially there is some big news underwraps so id be interested to hear what you guys think about it i definitely would love to know if theres any info im missing out on here as it seems like a clear cut winner to me i know that sls isnt a funny meme stock like gme but i honestly think its a worthy cause for us to support as a community especially because a bunch of investorshedgefunds are shorting a cancerfighting company to make some money which is a pretty scummy thing to do imo edit removed a sentence based on feedback
50,29,2021-02-04 14:08:39,the next step buy stuff from gamestop just checking in but wouldnt the next logical step after holding a hefty gme portfolio be to support gme with your business ie instead of throwing another $5k at the stock buy something you would want from them make their q1 go through the roof ideally it would be something where they make the most margin rather than an item where 90 of the cost goes to microsoft or sony
9,9,2021-02-04 14:08:00,how to fidelity instant deposit for faster yolo i know this is probably not the place but since so many joined fidelity recently can one of you help a smooth brain out the cash management account at fidelity which can also trade seems to have instant deposit but it does not work for the brokerage account or maybe its because i enabled margin on my is instant deposit basically a margin lite i was trying to buy gme in cash only and had to wait 2 days yes i ended up buying more 300 and yes im still holding
0,44,2021-02-04 14:07:06,im sad why does everyone here seem to hate silver now you guys scared the crap out of tptb for a day or two and then gave up on it wtf an army of shills was sent here to deter any attempts on silver and make it look like a gme distraction ploy they also paid off some journos to write stuff like dont even try it you cannot short squeeze silver and everyone now seems to have given up silver would be way more fun to squeeze than gme just notice how every single mainstream media outlet went up in arms firing 20 articles per hour as soon as you started talking about silver why do you think is that 1 ounce is $25 now its nothing if we go for a squeeze it could easily go parabolic this would be a systemic shock it would disrupt everything the spillover would be huge edit 2 fucking per cent lmao downvote bots are being used here to target silver posts wake up dont be a useful idiot
49,22,2021-02-04 14:06:08,how are we the ones getting monitored by the sec i just find it absolutely unbelievable how wsb is getting combed through by the sec for market manipulation when there is blatantly clear short laddering happening all day long anyone with level ii market data can see this the fact that the sec is turning a blind eye is disgusting my shares will be buried with me and will be etched on my tombstone to the sec intern reading this i know you saw the hundreds of posts on this sub highlighting the short laddering yet you probably have done nothing about it gme to the moon or the dirt i will hold till the end obligatory 
0,60,2021-02-04 14:05:26,hear me out should we really be killing robinhood i know were all extremely pissed off in robinhoods buy limitsbuy blocking which pretty damn directly killed gme momentum but ive been thinking a lot about this and i feel kinda guilty for jumping on the lets kill robinhood train theyre not my primary brokerage but the more i hear and read the more im convinced that robinhood basically had no choice but to set the limits they set theres no excuse for their lack of transparency when this happened and ill stand by that but really though would retail trading and wsb have the power they have if it werent for robinhood wall street is now fully painfully aware of the power we retail traders have we move markets even when they try hard to keep us from moving them and i think its pretty undeniable that robinhood helped create this and without robinhood we may not be able to sustain it weve now made them the target of the regulators not the hedge funds robinhood legislation and regulation that affects robinhood will affect every other retail brokerage every novice investor everybody who cant afford to put $25k into a brokerage account everyone who cant afford commissions its pretty clear to me that robinhood was more of the victim of corruption and manipulation than the perpetrator of it again theres no excuse for the lack of transparency and i hope theyve learned their lesson and we should hold them accountable but this sub has an immense amount of power and i dont think we should be aiming it at robinhood effectively our former friend when a friend stabs you in the back it hurts and i think we all feel that way but i dont think the blame lies with them and i think robinhood helps us a lot more than it hurts us food for thought fine to disagree with me and im open to being wrong and changing my mind im just worried about where this goes and i think we need to step back and look at the big picture if robinhood dies its the hedge funds and institutions who will be laughing a lot harder than anyone here will edit am retarded thanks for the reality check just needed some perspective on all of that
0,37,2021-02-04 13:56:51,the writing is on the wall and my mental health is declined fast im so mad at myself i shouldve sold all my gme share last week but i got greedy and diamonds now im left holding the bag all i can do now is hold and laugh at my misery also ive been having suicidal thoughts these last couple of daysmind you i am also a legal gun owner

16,2,2021-02-05 04:31:53,i dont see no stinkin shares being offered yeah thats right the only catalyst needed to define which direction were going to go until papa cohen delivers the news that a share offering has taken place we will fuel up for our tendie trip cohen and burry got into this trade because they understood the price was going to go up burry took some profit along the way but is still in this trade cohen took another step further and got his peeps on the board the next logical step is wipe the debt and build the war chest the next step happens with an offering while i believe there will be two offerings first to wipe debt and reset the fundamental story the second will be when the actual squeeze to mars happens no one on the news is talking about this at all there was one reference last week about gme management not taking advantage of an offering but we know they will it is only time and the diamond hands will be rewarded x200b btfd to the moon edit not financial advice caveat emptor e pluribus unum or some shit
5,8,2021-02-05 04:31:49,should i transfer my stonks out of robinhood now robinhood is clearly run by degenerates and i have some gme and other stocks in there i want to switch over to fidelity but wondering if i should wait what are your thoughts on this and is it even possible to do so right now

31,20,2021-02-05 04:29:15,why gme is going to continue its descent just kidding im here to ask a question actually is it just me or is every post promoting positive sentiment getting censored if you sort by new and keep the page loaded any post promoting positive sentiment or promoting diamond hands gets promptly removed as im sure this will too the news media is saying wsb lost all faith in gme yet half of the new posts which arent immediately deleted still speak to positive sentiment is it just me or am i just looking for hope with my 6 245 with so many like me youd imagine there would at least be a noninsignificant amount of crusading but it seems failed to be seen any opinions
13,8,2021-02-05 04:28:56,paper handed friend found a problem so my friend is on etrade he decided today he was done he needed money to pay bills hes down 30k and needed to save the last 7k or so that he had left etrade will not let him sell the gme it says he doesnt own the shares that are in his account just wondering what this means im still holding mine i just thought i should bring this to peoples attention
21,6,2021-02-05 04:27:43,i hope you idiots are right about gme i bought $59 of gme hopefully it goes up like yall say it will to the moon 
13,6,2021-02-05 04:24:45,why you should consider holding chances are the stock wont sky rocket whatsoever but ask yourself if its more prideful or even smart to get out now i feel like number of gme shares worth more than what youre gonna get now especially with all the changes gamestop did new hirings etc personally ill hold because it makes more sense to do so this isnt financial advise so pls dont take anything i say as is
54,6,2021-02-05 04:22:57,the fake news attack on monday is why im holding gme i dont know about short ladders i dont know about squeezes but what i do know is that there was a massive fake news attack that happened this week there was a reason why millions were spent on a media blitz falsely claiming we were investing in silver and looking at other stocks if gme was worthless if the shorts already sold if they couldnt care less about it or us then why the massive effort to divert attention from the stock and to drive the price down the media blitz happened on the monday after the gme surge if the shorts exited on friday then why the effort on monday to drive the stock down why is rh slowly allowing more people to buy more shares this late in the week im guessing its because theyre hoping you lost interest are discouraged by the dip and wont buy i dont know shit about stocks but what i do know is that i dont care about things that dont have an impact on me i wouldnt care about an anthill being destroyed in africa unless i lived in it so why would a hedge fund care about the price of gme if they already exited it was no coincidence that the guys who owned a billion in silver launched a false campaign that reddit was suddenly investing in it they needed more money for something maybe it was to cover their losses if they already exited but then there wouldnt be a massive media blitz to drive the stock of gme down after the fact im holding i just like the stock
42,13,2021-02-05 04:22:34,this will likely get buried but please dont ruin this sub i saw a top post today that rubbed me the wrong way it was telling people not to sell and to buy more i understand that there are millions of new people on here and many think this is some sort of pump and dump site we should not be advising people how to spend their money instead we should be giving insight into our thoughts on a stock and allowing them to make their own decisions the gme push was founded on legitimate dd that found the flaw in the death star its very possible the squeeze is still on its also plausible it has run its course please state your argument for either side and leave it at that we have already given ws a black eye if you think this is a losing bet and want to continue to protest flood the streets of ws write your congressman be relentless towards the sec about manipulation this sub is about top tier memes shitposts loss porn yolos and the unicorn quality dd not pressuring people into making decisions disclosure 20 shares gme 190 not selling
22,21,2021-02-05 04:21:45,gme yolo i just bought 100 more shares of gme to the moon
13,28,2021-02-05 04:21:01,who am i to say this but doesnt it seem a bit odd that there is only 1 view on gme around here literally the only thing im seeing around here is posts about holding and how everything is being manipulated with not a single post about any opposing view whats to say that gme won just keep crashing until it hits $10 and the hedge funds win its just that there doesnt seem to be any solid evidence that we arent all collectively being screwed into holding a forever dropping stock
8,33,2021-02-05 04:20:59,why is everyone selling gme well edit wouldnt it be cool if gme did the same thing twice
57,8,2021-02-05 04:18:54,were not fucking leaving retards and autists alike i know morale has been low recently we are being cheated out of our gains once again by big money fear not i know many of you have just recently hopped on the gme train but as someone who has been in this stonk for months it moves like a motherfucker within 2 days of buying my shares i was down about 40 shoutout the ujeffamazon post for the gme ogs gme moves erratically and ive honestly gotten used to the violent ups followed by the violent downs suck it up and hold the fucking line the stock market is the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient barren wuffet dont be the impatient retard its only a loss if you sell this is far from over buckle up double down whatever you gotta do dont you fold you can bet your ass these low prices are enticing to big money idk about you guys but i didnt hear no bell i love and respect every single one of you diamond handed champions we will be rewarded in the end stay strong brethren many good things coming to gme gang obligatory i am not a financial advisor but i can advise you which colored crayons taste the best positions 155 shares 3376 avg insert rocket emoji

3,17,2021-02-05 04:07:37,does anyone know when gme is going to hit the moon do we have an educated guess on then gme is going to take flight 123 shares and holding
22,18,2021-02-05 04:06:19,gme might be worth a punt at $60 right now $60 gme seems to be holding up pretty well im thinking it might be worth putting a little of the portfolio on just in case there are shorts still to cover im thinking they would cover eow or before 9th feb if it falls to $40 id lose 33 of a small no big deal if it pumps to $200 a few weeks of chikun tendies for relatively low risk
33,16,2021-02-05 04:04:36,they are in this sub and smarter than we give credit maybe im being a paranoid smooth brain but i suspect some of these why is everyone faltering we need to stick to it posts are propaganda what better way to convince people that the movement is over and get their message to the top then to pretend you want people to hold but that you see everyone failing doubt everything and when in doubt hold i dont care what youre in new or old gme youve been longing bb or pltr since before we had fresh blood or you joined nok as fresh blood the message is simple if youre here you know it hold paper handed bitches dont make history and the dont make tendies

54,13,2021-02-05 03:58:13,if ape hold banana banana dont fall to all the retards that are panicking do you all realize that the squeeze is inevitable it might not happen soon but it will happen the shorts are trying to weather out this storm before they close their positions in the future think about it like this gamestop appointed three new members to its management ryan cohen is not fooling around once gamestop starts publishing good results and steady growth the shorts have no other option than to close their positions how are they going to continue shorting a company that keeps performing good they cant they are literally waiting for us to move on from gme so they can offload their positions in a more calm market at a more affordable price this might take days but its gonna happen
34,21,2021-02-05 03:57:59,we are losing battle but its not over yet as the title pretty much says we are losing ground fast a lot of people are selling and thats normal given the spike that gme has many people joined and bought expecting a spike any hour now the truth is spike wont happen soon hf probably shorted more and got new positions which gave them more time for more paper hands to fold however this isnt over all we gotta do is wait for more dip buy for cheaper and hold this is going to take time so dont think that youre buying gme to flip it for a quick buck that wont happen whats going on right is probably going to take some time so strap in and hold gme to the 
33,8,2021-02-05 03:56:46,dont forget how much you have learned with shares dropping and palms getting sweaty its important to remind yourself of the lessons you have learned along the way im a new member of wsb i jumped on board just as the hypetrain was leaving the station by now i have learned so much about how the market works knowledge that will be useful for the rest of my life i will keep investing learning more becoming better i will take risks sometimes and make safe bets where i can was it an expensive lesson who knows i am still holding my gme and nok shares like a sloth that found a comfortable branch so win or lose take the valuable lessons learned and keep on going 
60,51,2021-02-05 03:52:54,so wsb big profit takers when are you going to tell the subreddit whats going on what a historical movement easy to blame the restrictions brokerages made for a day on the downfall but the only way a share can plummet is if you start taking profits everyone who took profits who plummeted the share to $65 are you going to get on here and let everyone whos new to the sub and the market know why theyre losing all their savings and youre up $100000 are you gunna tell them you didnt hold the lineprobably not guys so i will those versed in the market understood from day one that only a group of people will get out of this with profits or break even the first ones to profit take make the most profit and then down the intrinsic spiral it goes for those of you hanging on at $65 youre nearing the end of the spiral and youre likely down thousands and the only way to get gme back up get your money back is to start another movement to pump money into it like we saw at the start so if you dont see that happening dont be the fool clearly many before you have sold and left gme behind foot note edit i never was in gme watched from the sidelines and it was amazing everything it stood for now the comments in this post are its not a team movement you have to be smart i dont care about strangers losing money youre in the wrong sub ive been in the sub for years on multiple accounts i didnt lose money on gme i never got in for this reason im just amazed how much you sound like the hedge funds youre happy to get on here and spam diamond hands comments and hold the line all week and then start selling your calls and moving them into puts lots of people are affected by this smoke and mirrors bullshit rwsb king of pump and dumps the campaign slogan was hold the line worked out well for those who have been trading for years always does

33,205,2021-02-05 03:51:07,the gme squeeze is over this place is becoming a cult please stop throwing your money away and try to learn a lesson from this ive been a long time lurker in this sub it used to be very different from what it is now if youre buying into whats being spread here now understand that youre being taken advantage of the gme short squeeze was legitimate it happened the share price skyrocketed from $15 to $400 a share in a matter of weeks people who got in early enough made money people who jumped on late have only lost money period the share price is in freefall and thats not going to change the share price is not going to spike back up again the squeeze is over its been over im just looking out for the tons of new users here who have gambled more than theyre able to lose youre going to lose almost all of it if you cannot afford to lose 80 of your investment sell sell and cap your losses then take the time and effort required to learn more about legitimate investing in the future im sure im about to be bombarded by people calling me a bot im not a bot ive been an active redditor for more than 8 years sell lick your wounds and move on
9,2,2021-02-05 03:48:23,the big short or the social dilemma the apps made the bank forget the loveable faces of steve carrey and christian bale this movie is going to look like the social dilemma these apps that we thought gave us power outplayed us to become the tool ever tried to get a loan at 51020 to 1 investment its not happening within 2 minutes of installing an app unless you have a much higher than average credit line these apps empowered by social media push a stock that is at a peak gme in this case as 250350 people who have no idea downloaded the apps and filled in some basic information once they deposit 51020 the cost of a share they can buy one so they buy gme because thats the buzz and thats why they downloaded the app to the moon once gme falls below their margin value they will have their position closed they have become a machine to pay for shorts by buying a higher share and being force to close at a lower value but why would they restrict shares if they they wanted you to buy them so they could sell them cheaper to the hedge fund they were in bed with because it kills the momentum they did that exactly after peak media hype
134,12,2021-02-05 03:48:10,hold the goddamn motherfucking line im new to this group but brothers now is not the time for being panicky bitches and paper handed cunts hold the goddamn line the people are stronger than the system money is money this is a statement this is the legacy of all of us ape retards future generations will tell tales of this day when rwallstreetbets stood against wall street giants and refused to sell why cause fuck em all thats why will you live forever yolo gme 
74,53,2021-02-05 03:44:52,to those who have lost a lot on their gme trade heres why you should buy more if youre like me and youre fucking stupid and decided to buy in high youre probably thinking of selling now looking at that sweet 78 in your portfolio im in 2 380 cant even look at it anymore but if youre decided that this is going to be more than a money bath that teaches you something and instead a trade that teaches you nothing heres why you should buy more right now 1 its cheap as dog shit right now besides the fact that the stock is great and i like it there is always the possibility of a second squeeze especially with how much is still shorted 2 robinhood decided that now they can play fair and are letting retail buy up to 500 shares 3 most importantly you can hedge your losses using cheap shares assuming you bought at the ridiculous price of 380 if you were to do nothing and gme were to go up to 230 congrats youre now down 40 not much better but if you were to buy an equal number of shares at 80 as you bought at 380 going up to 230 has you break even moreover youve now got more shares than you started with so each dollar above 230 is two or however many shares dollars of profit to you hedge your bets with more cheap gme if you were to buy double your original shit investment it would only have to go up to 155 for you to break even assuming gme goes up from here which i think it will because the floor of diamond hands seems to be 80 you can find ways to profit even if youre losing on your initial trade
6,7,2021-02-05 03:44:36,new investor and what ive learned these last 2 months hello i would like to take a moment to say thank you to all the new information sources and insight given by everyone here secondly im new to active trading and stocks other than dropping money in and never looking into it im new to wsb reddit i just looked at jeep stuff before wsb and i actually got into really applying my money into stocks for long term investments in 2018 october 2019 i decided to make allotments to have reoccurring investments so much to speak that ive built a portfolio and was up and down day after day never paid attention in december 2020 is when the idea of my money make money for me came to me and i tried few weeks later this gme thing hit and i made some very emotional calls mixed with fomo with those calls came many lessons some takeaways to all my fellow new investors that ive learned and i hope people can learn from my mistakes without going through a never investgamblestock play with what you cannot afford to lose this goes without saying b a loss is only a loss if you look at it in such a manner where you have a loss theres a learning lesson and as boomer as it sounds with knowledge comes power the power to take past mistakes and fool proof your future plans c the stock market is a vicious and volatile area and money can be made as fast as lost it is possible to recover learn how do your dd c1 the stock market is not for everyone short term investments with high hopes of a fast bucks can become a long term ordeal that you may or may not be ready to handle d prepare for the worst hope for the best these are just some key points ive jotted down on my notes to myself and as i said if even one young investor can pick something from this and benefit from my mistake then its worth it thanks for your time edit not a financial advisor just sharing my experiences so far edit2 10 shares in at 209 ea still holding for some reason i think just for the principle of the initial idea other than make tendies
17,5,2021-02-05 03:43:50,motivation the concept has been proven this will never be over there is no going back now whatever youre doing right now holding or watching from a distance cuz youre broke me then it doesnt matter what matters has already been done you the people caused a hedge fund to collapse taking back capital for yourselves and scaring the fuck out of the ruling class response was swift they do not want you doing this but you did and it can be done again and they know it whatever happens to gme happens the fight isnt over but the battle has been won and it is glorious the war is just beginning though resist any legal measures that attempt to restrict your access to trading services by any means necessary this needs to happen to stock after stock this momentum cannot and must not fall off there can be no return to the status quo we know what can be done now how much power we all collectively have and how genuinely scared the elites were at the slightest sign of financial threat love you all its more than just gamestop now never forget the bigger picture and the significance of these events in relation to our material conditions
4,3,2021-02-05 03:42:35,wash sale question  i understand that if you take a loss you must wait 30 days to buy that same stock if you want the losses to be deducted from your income in my current gme situation i sold 120 shares for a 40k gain i then bought 164 shares if i sell these shares for a loss those losses will still be deducted from my income right
59,14,2021-02-05 03:41:47,the reason gme is not dead first off 93100 here so diamond hands this brothers now as far as i can see there are lots of people asking questions and wondering about buying gme what brokerages to use etc even if only half of these folks would eventually become a fullblown ape and buy some gme we are most likely to see an increase in gmes price and a second wave of interest from the media social media and what not diamond hands apes

94,35,2021-02-05 03:40:46,gme sentiment its very interesting to see the sentiment shift so violently and quickly in this sub we said last week to prepare for dips and flat days and to hold for as long as it takes even if its until march now that we can see that were actually right people are jumping ship and bashing the gme holders and saying its a cult dont be mad at us for holding just cuz you paperhanded your one share fellow gme bagholders well be flying high one day and well just have to hold until then x200b my positions 175 shares at 128 avg
47,15,2021-02-05 03:38:56,why holding makes sense if you need the money you shouldnt have bought into a gamble in the first place you asshat sell if you need it now if you can afford it best case scenario turn this into an investment gme is undervalued a lot of well done dd indicates so so its a relatively safe bet it was before this whole squeeze debacle less than best case scenario selling down the line when the price stabilizes you might lose less than now its highly unlikely it will drop even lower than at start logically way more people are aware of this stock now than before and the company is clearly using this opportunity to try and make a turnaround worst case scenario if you bought at the peak hold to remind yourself why you shouldnt buy at peaks you dumbass and at least out of solidarity help those who are holding too disclaimer this is not in any way shape or form financial advice i sniff glue run with scissors and rub my eyes with glitter
14,11,2021-02-05 03:38:44,where to go to find the truth on short positions i have been seeing a ton of articles how melvin and citadel have closed their short positions on gme from the info i have seen on wsb i think this is a lie anyone got any good sources that may be able to shed light on whether these guys have covered their shorts or not
96,15,2021-02-05 03:31:40,how i think this will all play out diamond hands my prediction diamond hands gme and hfers will come out of this okay at the expense of paperhands and non wsb retail investors how will this play out wsb retailers are now wise to the game hf and mms control the price of the stock and the mainstream media this time we are in control of the shares hfs need those shares but diamond hands arent giving them up so how do the hfs get them back by making average cnbnc viewers buy them but how massive short laddering and fud campaigns are an obvious ploy at shaking out any paper porn toys they can find every paperhand folding now is a cheaper share they need to buy back anyone left with skin in the game is gonna be hard to shake off but hfers arent gonna just pay up how will they get the average retailer to pay up there are a massive amount of 319 800$ calls that have been purchased hfers will use this to recover some of their money one day between 25 and 319 gme price will skyrocket from 90100$ all the way up to 500$ as hfers cover their shorts some of us will cash out our investments and leave a few shares to speculate others will fully cash out cnbc and cnn will be screaming from their platforms that the short squeeze has begun and everyone should pile in and get those sweet gainz average retailers will pile on driving the price up to somewhere between 5001000 then the hfers will ladder the stock down to 100 shaking down new paperhanders for cheap shares theyll leave it back at 100 for a few days to see if any other paperhanders walk off cnncnbc will help drive off investor confidence with fud campaigns rinse and repeat eventually hfers will get the shares they need by buying these shares up on the cheap from paperhanding retailers trying to get in on the squeeze not knowing that hfers and mms can artificially control the price of the stock through a combination of short laddering and short buybacks combined with the 25 puts the 319 calls and the massive swings in price that the hfers can control they will make all of their money back final outcomes diamond hands will make big gains no way are we getting back in at 500 if we know they can short ladder down to 100 average retailers will come in and buy shares from diamond hands for 1000$ hoping it will go to 2000$ the next day only to paperhand them to hfers for 100$ new retailers will flock to wsb to see the massive gains as folks cash out get greedy buy in only to get slaughtered the next day wsb will be filled with gain and loss porn gme will come out as a multibillion dollar company with a share value from 100300 with strong investor confidence cnbc and cnn will hail wsb as a hallmark moment for the little man that saved gme and will change the game forever wsbers will forget about the short ladder attacks the fud campaigns the trade freezing etc because hey we made money right anyone who bought in at 500 and held on for dear life will have a chance of getting out hell wsbers will be laughing at the average retail investor that gets slaughtered because they should have known better right a few hedge funds will walk out making massive gains a few hedge funds will implode and nothing on wall street will change except theyll start taking wsb a lot more seriously the average retail investor will continue to get screwed by wall street because they dont know that wall street controls the pricing on stocks bulls make money bears make money pigs get slaughtered tldr hfers are gonna do everything in their power to make the common retail investor the pig if we diamond hand this hfers will find greedy paper hand investors to buy our shares for them this is not financial advice and i am a retard

36,5,2021-02-05 03:20:49,i couldve made around $50k with gme last week but i didnt sell out holding because i like the stocks i believed in the real squeeze and went in with money i was willing to lose i also know i wouldnt have made that much profit if it wasnt for the dd yall post and hilarious memes my learning lesson is to pay myself yes sell a little at a reasonable peak but got caught in the momentum and wanted to stick it to wallst especially after what rh did and not let fellow astronauts behind like a true when rh had trade restrictions last thu i still bought 10 more shares thru my vanguard acct at some of the highs averaging up yolo gme were the first shares ive bought from any company directly and i def set myself up for a tesla or food stamps situation this experience has made me more wayyyy more aware about my financials so thank you wsb its also been hella stressful to see it all unfold not gonna lie still holding strong with you soldiers not financial advice just a damn eating 
0,11,2021-02-05 03:20:42,gme was a bubble i had a feeling it was i still bought at $300 cause fuggit yolo the gme chart does not match the vw chart so lets stop pretending like it does go look up literally any bubble and look at that chart and it looks like gme that being said diamond hands im not selling this is a dive not a dip but idc it still looks like a sale to me so im buying
19,7,2021-02-05 03:19:50,weve reached a big weekly support area for gme this $5864 area is the previous all time high and is a big support if it can hold expect a solid bounce gme holding the line here has potential to be a big win for bulls x200b x200b 
7,28,2021-02-05 03:17:18,a genuine question to the smart people in this sub my mind is confused about one topic and i think most of the people here are aswell now lets think about how heavily shorted gme was before the things that happened last week 1 we know gme was shorted like 140 when it was 1020$ 2 right now some say that the percentage of the shorts increased or decreased and we dont seem to have any legit data about this 3 lots of people say that the shorts have covered their original shorts which were around 5 to 10 dollars and instead have their shorts based on 300 to 400 dollars so my question is about the third argument how can so many people be sure that shorts that were originally underwater were covered it makes no sense as the hfs who owned these shorts had to buy most of stocks to cover and that alone would have caused the short squeeze to go astronomical but that didnt happen instead it went up just a bit my guess and it is just a thought and not a financial advice why wouldnt most of hfs be still under water i think right now what is going on is the hfs are trying to gobble up some stocks from a price point that is as low as possible to cover their original shorts so they dont lose that much money i just like the stock and i want you smoothbrains to help me to find an answer about this g m e to the m o o o o n 
210,20,2021-02-05 03:17:06,seeing too many people asking should we still hold the line the answer is yes yes we definitely should you damn dirty if you held after the previous run and are still in the gme then selling now would be absolutely pointless youd be taking a loss and if more people start thinking like this then we all lose the fact is that we expected all of this to happen it would almost be sus if hf and msm let us just shove our giant $cock into the market and do what we wanted we knew itd be a hard road after the last rush if you leave now then the dream slowly dies for each of us who do the same if we stick together and hold the fucking line then not only do we have a chance but well hit the fucking moon and then some dont be a scared be a strong this is not financial advice ya beautiful bastards
274,20,2021-02-05 03:16:42,at this point selling is just stupid i bought gme at 200 and im holding thats it period
27,5,2021-02-05 03:14:19,i believe in you hi everyone first of all i dont know sht about the stock market im a true retard however ive been lurking this subreddit for years i learnt a lot of things from that 1 we are retarded autists 2 stonks only go up 3 this community does not give up to all the newbies or long time wsb members ive got something to say last week when i bought gme at 330 i yolod 6k into it even though im now down 45k i dont paperhand or stop losing confidence in this community i have seen how these guys dont care about how much they lose they keep going and next thing you see when you open reddit is half a mil gains to everyone holding the line sooner or later you will be the one posting your half a mil gains remember that and to hell with those hedgies
29,30,2021-02-05 03:14:06,still holding but starting to have doubtsplz help i need some assurance here i bought gme $300 and it pains me to see the losses right now i understand no losses occur until you sell so im holding strong but seeing the price action dip to below $80 then recover to $120 to now sitting in the $60 range is becoming extremely disheartening and making me question if this whole thing is over does anyone have evidence or information to help me feel better about holding at these levels im not really expecting to make money on this trade anymore but rather than sell i figured id let you autist be my hypemen
51,15,2021-02-05 03:11:30,his palms are sweaty knees weak bags are heavy theres vomit on his sweater already bananas  to all you apes still holding the line youre golden this is your moment this isnt about money this is about right vs wrong poor vs rich do not despair you do not have a loss until you sell this is not the time to sell consider this your tuition your cost of entry people pay for degrees and get nothing you paid for a stock you paid for an investment and you are now a part owner of gme and you might just be the part owner of gme for life you didnt lose you are a part of history the question is which side are you on obviously this is not investment advice im just a rare snowape from northern canada 3 shares of gme $250 all this poor monkey could afford
53,24,2021-02-05 03:11:16,gme isnt short term anymore its midlong term hello smooth brains im going to break down the gme investors here into two categories one group bought gme because the believed the company was going to turn around and they saw long term value like dfv did the second group wanted to ride the hype cash in on easy tendies then bail while some people in group two may move over to group one most have and will bail on this stock and thats fine let them group one however which is likely who is making all the hold posts will not bail dfv lost millions on his current holdings and he as of now has no intention on bailing he believes in gme and knows its going places yes he sold some and he was smart for doing so as now he is set for life but he still took a temporary loss on 20 million because he believes in the company is gme going to moon this week or next probably not it might just keep dropping until we get another catalyst to turn it around if you havent noticed gamestop has been very very quit during all of this and i am certain a large part of that is corporate lawyers telling them to keep their mouth shut so if they get accused of stock manipulation there will be nothing to support it is the dip a bad thing though i dont think so what its doing is giving us the ability to really get into gme at a great price the more it goes down the further your dollar is going to take you simply put 1 share at $150 is 3 shares at $50 making your purchase 3 times more powerful you can try to time it out and buy at what you assume it the low point or you can average down buying up a few shares every time it drops a decent amount one happy day cohen is going to announce his plans or some massive deal he made and that is going to turn the stock green again hes not an idiot and hey made his move on gamestop because he knows he can do something big people like to argue that you can buy games anywhere but its branding that matters most remember you could buy pet supplies anywhere when he started chewy and look how that turned out this time though he has a powerful brand name already going for him and a massive amount of free advertisement from us also keep in mind once wall street realizes they are not a failing company anymore they will also start to pile into it lets remember blackrock owns 9217335 shares yes they sold 2 million shares but they unloaded a small chunk just like dfv did but kept the majority of their holdings overall if you believe in the company keep holding and average down if you can i bought in at $20 $21 $25 and $30 so i am averaging up but hey i like the stock if you bought in because you wanted easy $$$ and missed out you just need to decide on what to do yourself its not a short term play anymore and you need to ask yourself if thats something your ok with again its all perspective and not financial advice its your money and probably your banks because you borrowed so you decide what to do
2501,255,2021-02-05 03:10:56,gme hedge fund insider reporting edit this is not financial advice as you can see most of things going on with gme right now are just msm being paid to lure normies into selling their positions for background i work in one of the major finance companies not on finance but with machine learningtime series prediction but ive lots of meetings with lots of people and people talk i cant give away too much info because it may cost my job but the deep shit going on is over the charts in 100 years this event will be spoken of first of all not all hedge funds shorted gme this is important because of what is about to happen some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans im speaking of exorbitant amounts remember that 35 of the dollars ever printed were printed last year guess who is going to get a big piece of that why they want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium wsb opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others maybe people here didnt realize yet what they started but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now second big hedge funds are partnering up but this is where comes the problem imagine that you will try to rob a bank what make you sure that the people that you partner with wont kill you to have less people to share the money with this is the current situation this is the waiting hedge funds including the company that i work with are waiting for the money and to see who they can trust in the end they will all backstab each other this is the finance industry you cant deny it because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short yes the hedge funds all over again but is far easier to short at 750$ so is just a matter of who will short first at work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it that was what created this opportunity but some people never learn this is why you should hold im holding just for fun and to see this shit show if one day i sell i will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall we are living the ww iii of financial markets now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new d day meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side long but dont think that they care about you as a person coming with the atomic bombs one risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands as you like to call them may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack rendering all this useless hold if you can this is a game of patience soon the direction will change fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner or be bankrupt later cant say much but few funds already gave their ceos and managers some quite fat bonuses why this is the last song last dance they are looting the ship before it sinks you have no reason to believe in me im a random guy on the internet but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks if you put all of this together you will see that the silence of operations see the fucking low volume means the silence before the storm wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves x200b if you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior read this if you dont understand it read again this explains why you dont sell and you need to stick together
5,23,2021-02-05 03:08:32,short dd on stla hey all amidst all the gme madness id like to share a ticker i think could be great in the next few years its a little ev company called stellantis stla stellantis is an ev manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as fca and peugeot it just recently opened for public trading on the market they plan to have 39 different evs made by 2022 what makes this pick so great in my opinion is of course joe biden not just biden being there however joe biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into evs what company does the federal government use for the most part dodge which is owned by fca with stellantis very likely producing these evs we could see a very healthy surge in the companys value pretty short dd i know but i think this has the potential to be a great long term pick positions 20 shares 1575 2 012023 $30c contracts positions will increase once im not in metric tones of debt edit my dumb ass forgot cadillac was gm

51,6,2021-02-05 03:05:16,hold gme dont let it consume you like many of you i have been laser focused on the ups and downs of gme but no matter how much i look at it it doesnt change the fact that im still going to hold take 15 minutes that you would otherwise spend staring at gme in your underpants and open a new brokerage account not robinhood fund it and then take a break while you wait for the funds to transfer go on a walk buy something local try talking to a girl read a book learn something research other other new exciting and innovative companies for your next investment do something other than stare at gme when it comes times to make moves on gme youll know
0,34,2021-02-05 03:01:46,daily post to remind you your positions in this meme stock are stupid after going through a lot of the post history of these gme rally retards i see a common trend you know nothing about the market or stocks youve literally hopped on the bandwagon thinking youre part of some movement to destroy hedge funds hate to break it to you coming from a guy whos lost a lot myself in options over the years youre in a losing game with gme was this gme rally a week ago something interesting sure but if you think for a second the hedge fund buddies arent helping each other out and dumping the stock on you plebs youre just beyond retarded blaming small brokers like rh for your retard move of buying shares and not understanding how laws force brokers to carry multiples of liquid cash shows again your retardation i welcome the new autists and your interest in the market do some research and maybe learn options dump your money into some fds laugh about the losses but focusing on gme and thinking youre somehow going to rally a shit stock with bad fundamentals because 8mil people are here shows youre just insane and need to find a new hobby
40,4,2021-02-05 03:00:45,wild ride had gme from a year or two ago at $5 a pop has been a wild ride watching the gains explode and dwindle just gonna hold onto mine because i like the stock i remember being a little kid and my mom throwing my sister and i in the car and driving 2 hours to a remote gamestop to get us gameboy sps im in it because despite hating their trade in policy gamestop has been an influential part of my life since i was little i hope they never go under i dont know anything about investing so dont take this as advice but it feels good to see a company you love succeed
8,5,2021-02-05 02:58:51,some takeaways since im graduating in the spring and will be incurring a ton of student debt with no job lined up i bought into the hype to cash out well i knew what i was getting myself into i previously was never interested in learning stocks i thought it would be too much time and effort to teach myself the amount of reading and new information i have absorbed is amazing my shares in gme are just acting as a savings account thats not in bank as a student i get basically zero interest in my savings account time to let gme marinate as a full time student and working 25 hours a week i do not have it in me to day trade this last week my eyes have been glued to the phone i have not been efficient with my time i am going to use a platform that automatically trades stocks and etfs instead of having money in my savings account not earning interest i believe having it sit in an investment count will do me right in the years to come other new investors what were your takeaways
16,5,2021-02-05 02:58:15,im one of many whove learned valuable lessons this past week ive been a lurker here since about september made little to no trades with the only profit i made being from turning marathon from $3 and change to $7 and change as a free stock like many i saw the gme fiasco as a free money glitch i was uninformed did little to no research and immediately poured $700 that i probably couldnt afford to lose into gme when itd drop from 300 down to 200 id panic and sell just trying to get something in return this happened until the $700 was $189 and i felt like i was the biggest retard known to man although i pissed my money away and wouldve been better off wiping my ass with it we hurt the suits thats bigger than money im just a broke college student halfway towards a business degree and this situation could have implications for years to come so far ive learned do your research on the situation before you invest sometimes the real profit comes from fucking the suits raw dont panic when it drops youre playing into the suits plan theyre probably sitting there beating off at the thought of potentially millions of retards like myself throwing their money away you havent lost money until you sell likewise you havent made money until you sell dont invest more than you can afford to lose feeling depressed after a loss is normal and you will not profit off of every stock hopefully this will help some of the newer members like myself who have been considering hopping in this sub has gained over 5 million new members in the past week please do your research be informed and do not invest more than you can afford to lose id like to thank everyone in the wsb community the past week has been fun at one point i was 500 and change and i got greedy thinking $1000 a share was realistic and happening regardless of my loss weve done more to wall street than anyone has ever just off of one stock the future is bright
12,19,2021-02-05 02:58:08,i want to buy gme i am really tempted to dump a lot of money into gme right now that its below 100$ per share why should i will this actually come off im an investor not a speculator so would appreciate some solid advice
0,17,2021-02-05 02:57:27,short interest in gme at 23 now  guys this thing is a mission accomplished dont let anyone convince you to buy now if they are still pumping gme it isnt for the cause its because they bought in at 300 and need you to buy their shares off them lol i know were all retard but dont be an idiot lol
10,5,2021-02-05 02:53:20,cautionary tale for new investors to the sub hello fellow homunculi long time lurker first time poster this is a post for the baby apes out there and not for our kongs who have experienced loss i have never invested over $100 here and there with this gme explosion i thought itd be a good idea to throw 3 months rent at it that i had saved up 2 tips if you do that 1 have a month rent saved up at least because you will be evicted oops 2 invest only what youre ok with losing i didnt follow either step the bright side is i learned im a paper hand bitch i learned to never yolo and take calculated risk and most of all i learned that this sub even with my bad experience recently is putting up the good fight this is not me telling you to sell if you fan afford not to this is only a caution to new investors about how much you can afford to invest
5,20,2021-02-05 02:53:12,amc was a distraction and it worked gme is the only one we should be taking care of but instead a lot of apes bought other meme stock dividing the effort on gme one stock at the time would be so much more powerful to squeez the squozen squoz
15,2,2021-02-05 02:52:42,we have to be strong in spirit to all the retards that are panicking do you all realize that the squeeze is inevitable it might not happen soon but it will happen the shorts are trying to weather out this storm before they close their positions in the future think about it like this gamestop appointed three new members to its management ryan cohen is not fooling around once gamestop starts publishing good results and steady growth the shorts have no other option than to close their positions how are they going to continue shorting a company that keeps performing good they cant they are literally waiting for us to move on from gme so they can offload their positions in a more calm market at a more affordable price this might take weeks but its gonna happen
0,7,2021-02-05 02:51:21,gme listen up you smooth brained chimps gme has fucked you so hard youre still in the denial stage discuss
33,8,2021-02-05 02:50:26,dont look at your portfolio or the gme chart go do something productive and stop looking at the red chart everything will probably be fine im no financial advisor they cant hurt you if you dont constantly look at your losses or the price of gme i mean they are trying with vibrating your phone but dont torture yourself looking at the the price you are invincible if they cant reach you
11,42,2021-02-05 02:49:27,why is everything happening the opposite of what we were told gme
184,10,2021-02-05 02:48:17,i figured out how to get rid of my gme losses on paper woke up this morning and my gme was down 25 i reduced my losses by buying more gme now only down 15 might buy some more tomorrow if i see more losses investing is easy
22,4,2021-02-05 02:48:05,gme is decreasing because we want it is falling because people is getting scared but there is still hope there are not sellers only an enemy selling to himself x200b if you cant see your portfolio falling simply close your eyes go and do others things and forget you have gme actions x200b youll earn money without knowing but dont sell 
6,1,2021-02-05 02:47:50,plan b hold until end of feb then loss to carry forward i am in gme at an avg of $150 the next big date appears to be feb 9 depending on consensus analysis and the apes in the room i am going to exit end of feb and then come back 30 days later i like the stock so i can take the loss for tax purposes see usa rules on wash sales there is risk of preventing a buy back which is why i wait i am not a financial adviser and am going to take the loss against profits selling positions so i can buy more green potential holding for now i like the stock and my fellow smooth brains
34,3,2021-02-05 02:47:21,just bought 4 more lets goooooooo or we all lose or we all win gme
124,10,2021-02-05 02:47:08,bought $200 and im deep in the red it doesnt matter because not only do i like the stock but i like the community this is my first time posting here and ive been having some real fud seeing gme go to $60 and below not like id paper hand because why would i no point in selling at this low of low what i would like to say however is that seeing others in the same position is comforting all the people still holding while in the red and still is honestly comforting i didnt think id be happy losing money i couldve bought new pc parts invested that money to safer options or literally just not spend it on such a huge bet but instead i bought it hoping for the short squeeze will it come i dont know did it already happen at $400 probably but lurking in this sub for a while i knew that what i spent my money on was more than just to profit but to show those hedge fund billionaires what a community can do we sure did stress those guys out of their comfy highchairs huh i find peace knowing that a lot of us are holding till the end and that im not alone in being in the deep red i like the stock and so do others therefore i will hold till the end thanks wsb community really is something else
35,8,2021-02-05 02:46:42,a message to the paper hands  i know you paper handed bitches sold your anus and now feel fucking salty about the loss and you fuckwits want everyone to losetrying to become the voice of reason in the comments and doing free shill work for the headge fucks telling the scared retards that they should sell just like you did to make you feel betteryou dumb fucks sold so you need to move on and leave us diamond balls alone matter of facts its a good ridance just go about your day and fuck off but doing this dirty work with your i told you so comments and doing more damage to autists who actually are already anxious and stressed adding to the fuel is no good nobody asked for your expertise or advice so stfu well take it from here btw gme is going to the hundies 1000 3rocket emoji3
28,14,2021-02-05 02:42:32,guess what am i doing right now  im buying more gme 
49,20,2021-02-05 02:42:31,please think for yourself i think it is time for me to post something everywhere i look there people grasping around for good news andor conspiracies i know its hard to see your portfolio drop like this for the first time this can cause emotional trading and thats been proven to never be beneficial i think its important to take a step back from it all and paint the bigger picture for yourself not every bullish theory is true and not every bearish theory is true try to distinguish fact from fiction for yourself the points below are just tips that i think might help you 1 we dont know until the 9th of february if the shorts have been closed the original reason that this stock gained so much popularity was the short interest as far as we know nothing has changed yet on this part even if it has there is nothing we can do about it but hold andor buy more we know for sure that the short float number of 140 was right due to the massive report losses for melvin and the reports so as long as no 100 factual news is released on short interest we should just wait 2 if you believe in gme keep the hype going as long as there is hype around gme there is a chance for a breakout if you are stressing about your positions get engaged in conversation try to think about why you decided to buy in the first place weigh pros and cons of other people arguments but dont get carried away solely by gme bulls or gme bears the more people talk about this stock the higher the chance that this is your willy wonka ticket to tendie town 3 stop looking at your screen 247 you are only working yourself up it is best to just set alerts for price and notifications for reddit posts if you really want to looking at the price every minute is not going to change it thinking about gamestop every minute can really swing your opinion in the extremities by this i mean that you will only believe news from one side of the spectrum the more you look the more you stress the harder it is to think rationally 4 making a list with the news around the stock can help the news on gamestop has been changing a lot each day there are many negative and positive posts each with their own arguments try not to get carried away by a day with mostly negative or positive news rather make a list of all the news so you have an overview this way you can take a step back from the current opinion personal opinion i think that as long as the short interest has staid high there is a chance for another breakout in my opinion melvin capital and other shorters will try their best to make back their losses and the only way to do that is by shorting gamestop all we need to do is keep the hype going talk about the stock repeat your bullish thesis and keep believing i know its scary to rely on other people not selling their stock i think its best to compare it to selling your 10$ lottery ticket for 5$ before the results have been drawn the only differences is that we actually have a chance of winning the fact that this has gotten so much more media attention than normal pumps should also be reassuring ps this is not financial advice i am just a regular investor who saw the short float and wanted to try his luck i own 27 shares of gamestop at $230 will buy more if it keeps dropping wish the best of luck to you all in the stock market trading should be fun
0,16,2021-02-05 02:39:37,many ape bagholders dont call urselfs diamond hand gme apes call yourself trash hand gme bagholders yall lost its over im glad i ignored all the hype i still am in things like apple and i havent lost a single buck had i listened to all your diamond hand bullshit when gme was 320 i wouldve lost all damn

0,40,2021-02-05 16:32:28,unpopular opinion udeepfuckingvalue played you no more updates because i would assume he is out so many idiots in here insisted to hold because he was still holding despite his $13 mil in cash he saw the short interest and played it well many of you became bag holders because of it people passed on life changing money to be a part of a false cause a slow well thought out dd eventually spurred mob mentality a different user name on youtube and reddit were used to help spread the falsities of common consensus mere weeks after horrible earnings the stock tanking to near single digits and more store closures there was suddenly momentum a generation of people that make the majority of purchases online and go to forumschatrooms to socialize had finally accrued enough mob mentality to think a narrow focused brick and mortar store was worth something the generation that spent a decade mocking boomers was now furiously climbing over eachother to support a boomer built business convinced it was worth more than worldchanging businesses like google tesla microsoft apple and life saving pharmaceuticals the biggest story here is not the crushing of hedge funds that will recover but the duping of simpletons that wont recover edit for disclosure i played calls on gme when i saw momentum got in and got out
760,94,2021-02-05 15:38:52,a comment i just found i think everyone needs to hear gme alright you fucking retarded chimps if you cant read have your wifes boyfriend read this out loud to you because if you lasted this long or have been watching on the sidelines you need to be reminded of who we are and how we got here this sub has gotten really negative in the past few days and its a real fucking bummer a few weeks ago our motto was diamond hands buy the dip and hold the line elon musk tweeted at us we were the focus of conversation on all social media platforms and every news outlet all over the world now bots and weak ass paper hand bitches are shaming you for holding they are telling you to sell they are making fun of you for buying the dip at this crazy low price when they themselves bought in at a $100 and then again at $200 and then again at $300 and again at $400 and then they pussy footed and panick sold think back to just a few days ago when mark cuban did an ama he said if nothing has changed and you can afford to do so fucking hold ask yourself then what changed there is no new information whether they covered or not so in whos interest is it to get you to sell right now you think some random primate on reddit is suddenly looking out for you and wants you to make financially sound decisions this rotten shit hole is not rstocks its fucking wall street bets we are here to take massive risks because while the out of touch millionaires all over the world made record profits last year they closed the economy sent you a $600 check and told you to fuck off they want you to continue to deliver their prime packages and shop for them at whole foods amidst a deadly pandemic while they sit safely in their mansions and tell you youre an essential worker and that were all in this together its in their interest to drive down the price as low as it can go so they can slowly buy it back up a little at a time and minimize their colossal losses bigger than their wifes dildo because they are the true retards who got so greedy a week ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and now they are pulling every dirty trick in the book to get you to sell and crash the price lower and lower the push to $500 last thursday was not the squeeze how do i know this i dont know anything because i fomoed into this stock because i read at a 3rd grade level and i failed algebra and never went to college but when the price hit $500 i know that robinhood removed the buy button to get you to stop buying they cried for more regulation on tv they paid for ads on cnbc to get you thinking they covered they purchased ads on reddit to get you to buy silver and different stocks they purchased bots to overrun this place and question why you bought in the first placee this isnt over and gme is not going to zero in fact the new ceo is hard at work to make a huge comeback no this isnt financial advice i dont know what im doing and im not telling you what to do im just ape diamond hand clutching 70100 and im not fucking selling this is not financial advice do your own research edit i didnt think this would get any points feel free to copy it and post it as a separate post to wsb if you feel more people need to hear this
1,21,2021-02-05 15:17:38,bring back the loss porn about 7 million of you bag holders probably didnt even know this is a casino nice job buying into propaganda blindly you fucking retards a whole lot of looking like because they didnt bother to check what wsb was like before it was taken over by pack mentality and the media but let me tell you its about time for some people to realize that much like the most recent spacex launch the gme to the probably blew up in your faces and i want to feel bad for the young people that got roped into this naive enough to think they were breaking the machine while actually being a part of it but id really rather just see their loss porn
8,26,2021-02-05 15:05:01,i was wondering about $gme when is gme shorts gonna start executing when does the bank start ik the hedges are beating down the price but when is the shoot up
21,3,2021-02-05 14:53:38,on top of an apparent movie deal this shit comes across my feed  a lot of people are gonna be milking this shit thats a given i havent been here very long and i know i probably dont have much room to speak for this site but i definitely have witnessed similar instances elsewhere im reading about this coup that took place over a dumb moviefilm thing and i cant help but feel bad for the real ogs of this subreddit idk im kind of ranting here but this gme rebellion for the most part has been something positive for the average person it brought me here afterall and got me thinking more about how i should be more involved with investing in general the greed thats on display now coupled with the shitty ass rigged wallstreet game to fuck the entire movement is disheartening again i dont have much room to speak in this group but myself here but this shit pisses me off and unintended consequences are drawing folks that are only here to seek profit at the expense of the integrity of rwallstreetbets i have absolutely nothing to gain financially by participating its a gamble but its not about the money to me you all made these fuckers afraid of the common man and thats what the real gain from this is id be very sad to see folks get demoralized and give up especially due to internal scumbags trying to take advantage of the situation that never gave 2 shits until it became famous rant
38,10,2021-02-05 14:50:53,rwallstreetbets should add a gambler helpline to their page it will only help guard against regulatory scrutiny in upcoming months that said i know that theres a lot of people that are struggling with recent financial losses but you need to take care of yourselves i know too many people that have ruined their lives from blowing their weekly earnings at casinos and in turn take it out on their families the scale of the gme craze is another level there are likely thousands of everyday people that have thrown out their life savings because of it please take care of yourselves edit even if this gets downvoted to oblivion i hope that theres at least 1 person that gets help
45,52,2021-02-05 14:44:25,now is not the time to hold gme now is the time to buy gme the hedgies have done a great job to bring gme back down so that they can cover their shorts they need you to be worried they want you afraid and selling your shares so they can cover theirs thats what this week has been about pat yourselves on the back hedge funds dont pull this kind of collaborative market manipulation flat out breaking the law and risking their livelihoods unless their back is to the wall that is what has been accomplished by a bunch of potatoes i know some of you are in deep yup thats how it goes sometimes but just remember that youre not in as deep as some of these hedgies who will be going to jail for market manipulation its scary thats how a revolution is supposed to feel edit robert downey jr was wrong its time to go full retard
26,14,2021-02-05 14:42:33,gme what todays data shows im back again with the positioncost distribution update and an explanation for what i think happened today you can see my previous post here for folks who dont know what position cost distribution is heres webulls explanation source webull since todays price was around the most historically crowded points on the chart the scale of the xaxis wasnt aligning with yesterdays chart anymore webull doesnt show the unit on the axis so i manually aligned the two charts from yesterday and today by eyeballing 23 24 assuming that my alignment is correct and im reading this chart correctly the pattern seems to be consistent with previous days a massive number of shares have been added to the float again putting the first chart i saved from 21 next to 24 and aligning them again i got 21 24 my conclusion is that some folks have been adding a shit ton of gme shares to the float this week by shorting the shit out of gme what is important to me here is that i dont see any evidence of a big selloff on these charts after looking at gmes option chain again i noticed that hundreds of thousands of put options 2m options or 200m shares were purchased in the last few days a lot of which will expire in the next 3 weeks so the short sellers are probably the market makers who are hedging the put options that they sold and also sell the previous shares they bought to hedge their calls ie reverse gamma squeeze i doubt that folks who have bought these options are planning to exercise them 200m of gme shares dont exist so the writers of these calls might have to cover their short positions once these options expire in or out of money my guess is that on top of this many of the shorts tried to cover before feb 1st so that the next official short interest data shows a reduction thats probably why they also bombarded these three weeks with put options now they are using all of that again to short gme and make back the money as if magically total shares of gme will increase dont get me started on s3s moronic synthetic shares nonsense if i borrow your banana there are two bananas is the kind of logic even a dont buy my plan is to wait until the dip stops dipping i mean they will run out of shares to short at some point right and buy more shares i think buying gme on margin is a horrible idea some folks figured it out the hard way this week so ill keep buying on my cash account i mean at lower than $50 a share i think this is easily a value play again gmeddcom disclaimer im not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice this is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise ive been long gme and have a lot of gme shares and a few gme call options tldr it seems like today did attacked

162,16,2021-02-05 13:54:42,citadel hold loss 200 a few days ago i looked for the most shorted stocks in europe i found a short position of almost 2 years of citadel the stock in question in a short time has gained a lot but citadel does not cut its losses x200b x200b x200b x200b they are also retarded i bet the short on gme 200 x200b do you think they sold at a loss no melvin was loaned money to keep the shorts open point72 boss laughs like crazy reading our comments they are all short my advice is to hold the stock in my opinion the drop is due to the new reddit users who bought but have no experience so they sold to limit their losses their behavior made the quotations fall ive been saying since last thursday that this game will last 23 weeks hold x200b in europe they have to report immediately to the supervisors when they exceed 020 and then they have to report the same day if they change the short position by 010 x200b conflict of interest i have 400 gamestop shares and tomorrow i buy another 500

0,10,2021-02-05 13:33:35,if your holding now youre just holding the bag for hedge funds if youre holding now youre just holding the bag for hedge funds the problem with the idea of gme is that if we all hold the price will continue to rise the problem is not paper hands who sell the problem is hedge funds and other firms who own millions of shares of gme we are not in control and the truth is we were never in control its likely these hedge funds will continue to sell off their shares when you hold youre not sticking it to the big guy youre helping the big guy by holding the bag for them 
10,30,2021-02-05 13:28:18,god please give me something other than gme i get it big hype and fun and memes i enjoyed it too but seriously every post is gme the dd section is all gme this im holding for the cause is ridiculous would you keep hitting till you bust at blackjack because its about sending a message i just want to read dd and laugh at memes of something other than gme we are not a movement were gambling
208,39,2021-02-05 13:26:51,listen up there is no doubt there was a sell off by some of us today the volume correlates with that i genuinely feel for those of you who risked it all on gme one thing id like to mention is the hedges have undoubtedly thrown every piece of arsenal they have in our direction the final piece that will end this war is turning us all on each other thats what im currently seeing im sure its funny for the lurkers to look at the loss porn it must feel great to say i told you so no one really cares whether the squeeze has been squoze or not is irrelevant to me personally i dont think it has i will hold my shares until im dead gme to the fucking moon 
27,14,2021-02-05 13:26:27,please read to everyone that needs to move forward i know many of us were counting on gme going to the moon but it didnt and thats ok stocks go up and they go down thats the game and im not saying its over we never know what can happen from here on out but like mark cuban said the next time we do go head to head with wall street well be prepared and we wont go in blind despite the fact that i personally have lost career ending amounts of money im not upset if anything this was an amazing learning experience and im proud to of gotten to be apart of this movement in the span of one week ive made both enough money to set me for life and lost enough to rethink the next steps in my life i know many people in this community are looking for some sort of confirmation bias they want someone to tell them that the thousands of dollars they lost werent for nothing that if they just wait one more week theyll make all of it back even though i wont be selling anytime soon i have accepted the reality that there is a chance gme will not return to its formal glory im sorry if you were left behind holding the bag i am among one of those people but thats life and by no means is this over we will return and when we do we will be stronger than ever 500 130
12,26,2021-02-05 13:25:09,it really wouldnt be that hard for gme to revolutionize the gaming industry by simply bringing back what we all want to rent the latest games to hit the market and in all reality how hard would it be for gme to become the biggest online digital rental gaming platform in the world i used to remember going to blockbuster and renting games so i wouldnt have to buy them or have different tier rental packages which enables you to beta test weekend packages weeklymonthly rental packages kinda like the netflix of online game rentals plus access to all classics at anytime with a paid subscription its really not that hard you dont need all the brick and mortars but some here and there to handle platform sales and hard copy sales any thoughts

25,9,2021-02-05 23:28:31,for everyone saying ladder attacks havent been mentioned anywhere before last week and were made up by wsb you should learn how to fuckin google the shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares they will do what has been called a short down ladder it works as follows short a will sell a counterfeit share at $10 short b will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position short b will then offer a short counterfeit share at $9 short a will hit that offer or short b will come down and hit short as $9 bid short a buys the share for $9 covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit by repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral if there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic failstodeliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit company news days are frequently attack days since the news will mask the extraordinary high volume it doesnt matter whether it is good news or bad news link seeking alpha 1252014 5 gme 190
0,5,2021-02-05 23:23:07,why silver is the play of a lifetime satire  since silver is a tradable commodity you can take deliveries of it this is important because you need to physically have it to make bullets why do you need silver bullets because werewolfs i think the market hasnt priced in the full scale of werewolf penetration into our population working with basic numbers according to herodotus there was a large population of werewolfs beyond thrace and across the ister working with some rough estimations for the size of the population in the region the village was maybe around 2000 people if we subdivided this excluding non werewolfs there were maybe 400 werewolfs present at the time using some quick calculations the world population at the time was 150000 and it is now 78 billion that gives us a growth factor of around 52000even bigger than your gme gains if we add that to the estimated 400 werewolfs present we come to the conclusion of 2080000 werewolfs alive right now based on extensive field research from bubba i have concluded the average werewolf takes 7 bullets to kill completely if we need to coat each bullet in an ounce of silver thats 145600000 million ounces of silver which converts to 9100000 million pounds of silver silver currently trades at 20651$ per pound this means 1879000000$ of silver need to be purchased this is a massive in priced in demand of silver currently tldr silver need silver to kill werewolfs

0,28,2021-02-05 22:55:55,i dont understand stocks but people are posting that they are holding their stocks stating that they bought them like when they were 300 ish something i google gme stocks and i see that they are at 50 ish what im not getting here people are hopping that the same meme wave comes over like in some days again out of nowhere wasnt the point of holding the stocks keeping them at the same or higher prices they are decreasing everyday please someone clarify a noob like me
314,37,2021-02-05 22:16:00,the spirit here is completely different today   ever since the plummet of gme bad mods trying to take over and bots spamming with demoralizing agendas its nice to see that people are still holding up against it the bad mods are also mostly gone and i feel like the entire spirit has been a lot better today than the last couple of days and that i just appreciate it has been it is and it will continue to be an honor to hold with you apes but listen retards we still have something they want thats just the reality soon it will be our time to launch an attack keep fucking buying theres a huge fucking sale we just have to be patient another weekend is upon us and as someone said last friday turn of your phone get some fresh air and enjoy it the stonks will still be here monday fuck reading the news anyway we already know where they stand in this take care lads and if anyone wanna play videogames when we arrive on pluto dm me to 69420 not financial advice i just like the stock
0,22,2021-02-05 22:02:05,most of you that are holding gme now and are holding thinking they would rather lose the money might very well lose it explanation in post this is not financial advice i know this is very hard to digest guys but please remember that in the markets you are in for yourself not for wallstreetbets not for anybody there is a saying there are no friends in wall street holding now thinking that it will be just like vw in 2008 is insane the vw dip was caused by shorts this is why the squeeze in vw even happened short interest in gme is at about 50 which is not bad but most of the shorts now are probably shorts that shorted after the original shorters bought back meaning that these shorts are in the money right now also gme is recovering a bit as a company going into ecommerce getting ryan on board but even the current price 60$ is not justifiable for a company such as gamestop if you need the money i would highly suggest you sell but if you want to be a retard and let your 30 40 50 loss get into a 90 loss you might as well do it i personally didnt invest in gme and i am not shorting it right now but beware of people shaming you for selling paper hands weak hands dont be shamed into losing your money tldr dont hold if you still want money the squeeze is done those with diamond hands are on track to lose money and if you can be shamed by reddit into holding youre a retard
50,64,2021-02-05 21:57:26,my humble thoughts on gme wsb and the future of the stock market as we all know millions of lower and middleclass people around the world were robbed in daylight for hundreds thousands and millions of dollars by brokers and hedgefunds what was a completely legal tactic by the people was halted and illegally disrupted to the point of possibly no return we got mad rightfully so and today we continue to watch as gme continues to plummet the most saddening thing of all is that gme could fall to $5 tomorrow and nobody would say a damn thing no one is going to stand up for what happens to them we are all going to resume our lives after losing what couldve been lifechanging money this is why things will never change in my humble opinion at some point we have to say no more we have to actually do something in order for their to be change but most people would rather take it in the ass then disrupt the comfort of their meager lives personally i have a family to look after and protect so my question to you all when do we say no more what is it going to take and what are we actually going to do edit to clarify im still holding
71,23,2021-02-05 21:43:54,what if the broker restrictions backfire on the shorts so i am a longtime wsb lurker and lowfunctioning autist with an idea i wanted to share x200b in my understanding a squeeze started on 26 jan and the hedge funds started to hemorrhage cash at an alarming rate they had no choice but to pull out all their dirty read illegal tricks to avoid the full squeeze so they got rh and all the shitty brokers to limit buys so they could get price down and do some covering at that time a lot of the who bought in late folded as they were going to anyways no hard feelings to them to each their own leaving them with the realized loss and only leaving the standing although some shorts were covered it seems like there were other short sellers waiting to jump in so in theory maybe melvin did bail at a multibillion loss and the next hedgie asshole stepped in to short heres the thing though the broker restrictions actually did block a lot of us from buying in more at the peak thus leaving us with more ammo to buy in now i was late to the game and a very small fish in the pond but most of my position was purchased after restrictions were lifted it seems like the hedge funds planned on playing the long game assuming they can scare us into selling but i think were in for the longer game the way i see it x200b i am happy to hold an unrealized loss if its still costing some asshole whos still shorting even if did hand some of the money back its very clear hedge funds did eat big losses already and that feels good who knows what the real short interest really is but ive got all the time in the world to wait and see if there is still a squeeze to be squoze we protected the company from bankruptcy and retail employees from wall st predators happy to give the new ceo a chance to turn around the company of my childhood feels good to be a part of a populist uprising of sorts against these assholes hoping we get something out of this like more decentralized financial infrastructure x200b for those of you who bet your retirement on this i wish you luck i will be among the many holding strong for the longlong game you can count on us x200b 5 gme 125 not a financial advisor just like the stock
89,13,2021-02-05 21:40:34,why gme is still a worthy investment disclaimer i am no expert and this is not financial advice its just what i think gme is still an incredibly shorted stock and with the buying power we have we can somewhat mimic what we originally did with gme if the hedge funds knew they were in the clear and that the squeeze had already happened there wouldnt be a need for so much market manipulation this week they are not in the clear yet they still havent covered most of their short positions because some of us arent selling they are trying to drive down the price as much as possible before the 9th when the shots reports are released so before then we should take this as an opportunity to buy shares at a discount price only if you can i reckon the price will go up after the 9th but its more likely to do so if we buy up the shares now hedgies are screwed if they cant buy their positions back before the 9th lets make sure it stays that way there is 8 million of us let that sink in also though it doesnt mean much the after market price is up by $5
166,25,2021-02-05 21:38:05,one thing billionaires dont have an ear to the ground of the american public a gme bull thesis one thing that billionaires dont have that has been proven time and time again and that is an ear to the ground of the general public this is winded but worth a read as its a minority thesis i am not a financial advisor i am not a finance person i am nothing more than a low stakes poker player with a mere ba in economics and this is not financial advice its simply my thesis and my play i was aware of the theory of gme when it was around $11 i had no clue if it was real or not i saw the 140 short i honestly thought it was a mistake or something after gme dipped from $20 to $16 i was about to throw a few bucks in and see where the cohen theory went and if a squeeze happened great but then the capital attack happened and i was concerned and was sitting on 90 cash so i pulled to my bank till after jan 20th then after i redeposited and behold gme is at like $5060 well damn so i felt i had missed the boat then something happened gme rocketed to $120 and all the talking heads on tv started to squirm billionaires were on tv comparing reddit to cop killers from the capital attack the gears of the elite machine started to turn and i called my buddy and said you know what its real this mfer is going to moon their borrowed to the fucking gills maybe even more than we realize so i looked at my financial situation and chose an amount to put to work on this and decided to dollar cost avg in the next day we got a $73 dip i was in we rebound off $73 and then elon tweets on a move up when gme was $149 it opens the next morning at $260 that really sucked mr musk thanks so i have skin in the game and am not prepared to make any more moves after that kind of move up so i wait and watch we get a few small dips and i dip a few more dollars in before this thing moves to the stratosphere still only approx 15 in at this point que gme moving into $400 range all the news outlets are starting to talk now its on a bunch of stuff cnbc is trying to ignore it talking about msft moving 3 trying to ignore the elephant in the room boomers around town start talking about they are asking me questions about whats going on but they all say the same thingif that gets back to around $50 im going to buy some gme moves toward $500 the talking heads cant ignore it anymore the stock market starts bleeding their pleading with people to stop the president is getting asked about it congress is getting in my dog is fucking watching the tv to see whats about to happen the super bowl isnt even being talked about amongst gamblers the whole world is looking at gme and boomers are asking if they should buy at $500 and that is when it hit me this could crash the economy during this move from $260 to $500 i started to notice trends setting in at $360 $330 and $283 it was really struggling to get over the $360 hump checked the market cap $22 billion i think i told my friend i dont think the retail guy has enough money a guy on cnbc said maybe friday morning ok so they are going to try to crash the entire market what price do we have to get to 40 billion so i looked at what gme is at 40 billion its $573 if i remember correctly so when we were at 22 billion i asked myself where is the other half going to come from it has to be people with cash and they are terrified of these prices why would they put the majority stake in at $30k for maybe a 100 return when a guy with $1000 in takes 11000 the avg joe isnt buying this here its going to have to crash before it squeezes if this isnt the squeeze and these people up big are going to start taking profits to my suprise it breaks into the $500 range the markets are literally fucking tanking on positive vaccine news as this thing moves toward that $571 number i tell my buddy this is exactly what i said would happen at these prices so did i sell hell no this thing was about to pop then rh happened at first i went conspiracy level shit and thought did they just fucking stop the economy from crashing by doing something illegal what is this communist china but then it made more sense people had borrowed on the margin to push it this high that fast and rh literally wouldnt have the cash to pay these fucking people which reinforced everything i am thinking at this point friday closes at $320 the boomers are all talking gme now as a deal at these prices but their scared their old they have to retire soon que monday morning silver monday morning silver squeeze was not put out there to divert attention of young people from gme it was to divert the boomer to the thing they love most good old metals they pushed an ad campaign to get boomers to think we havnt missed out these youngsters are about to push silver to the moon and even if they dont metals are safe metals are good for the boomer retirement so now all the boomers are talking silver and that is when i made adjustments to my dollar cost avgng this thing was going to crash there wasnt enough money to push it over the top without getting cash holders and boomers in i am a cash holder they needed i wasnt coming in at $300 the boomer was not with you and the profit takers were up huge and the pressure was on them so i sold at $325 with the plan to double down on the way down to $60 double again at $60 and then double again at $50 with hopes that the boomer would see $50 as a chance to get in and we would see a bounce off $50 they moved the silver market nearly 10 monday over a 1 trillion dollar market well now its today and guess what boomers are not talking silver in the streets their talking gme at $50 cash holders are not talking aapl their talking gme and gamblers are still not talking about the super bowl their talking gme their talking about feeling like they were lied to by the media about silver they heard cramer tell reddit to not go for the grandslam go for the homerun instead take your profits they know the establishment squirmed and they dont squirm over a lame 20 billion loss a curtain was almost pulled back and a lot of people are sure curious about what was behind that curtain at $573 and what is wall street doing celebrating enjoying it doubling down on puts its atlanta 28ne 7 with 3 minutes to go in the 3rd qt in the super bowl its over the billionaire owner is on the sideline waiting for his trophy but what if there is a spark a tiny bounce off $50 a dropped pass that gives the ball back to save a glimmer of hope boomer sees price going back up gambler sees price moving back up cash holder sees price moving downside probably 50 upside huge a buy then another momentum maybe probably not some holders see a new opportunity to bail price falls and yet another buying opportunity to open the curtain another buy another buy no sellers at these levels they have had 5 opportunities to bail momentum builds the news starts talking again rolling their eyes people start to think its happening more come in process repeats until there is enough momentum some profit takers start thinking what if i am wrong if i put in 50 profits ive still got 50 and to the moon we go to open a magic curtain with something behind it that makes everyone nervous for some reason or maybe we just crash to $5 so what i have been betting on is simple wall street is amazing at this game but they are not on the street they dont have their ear to ground i believe that they played this perfect just like i expected them to and i am betting they have underestimated this and have doubled down again without the knowledge of the talk on the streets being around regular people thinking this forum was their biggest threat and have in the process overextended themselves in the process again do i think they are still heavily shorted hell yes do i think the economy is at risk no they likely deleveraged enough to remove that option by reducing some of their own risk but another $bn loss is a lot of tendies to go around x200b edit cubans comments about regrouping applies here x200b x200b tldr wsb and rh not enough money gme falls to $50 hf celebrate hf double down boomer no like silver boomer like gme gambler no like super bowl gambler like gme cash holder no like market like gme gme go brrrrrrrr again profit taker see new opportunity for hf go bye bye
0,41,2021-02-05 21:29:05,why not simply move on to the next shorted stock and hype it through the roof hear me out gme allowed us to bankrupt some hedgies and bleed them out of literal billions why is it imperative to squoze the squeeze when we can just start hyping the next shorted stock holding gme is fine but it shouldnt stop us from taking other positions am i missing something here lets hype again
34,34,2021-02-05 21:18:48,this is not financial advice this is not financial advice well in my absolutely unique circumstances for me the perfect time to buy is right now your circumstances are different so do not read further im thinking there are 85 million on this sub we have normal leadership resuming there is a fucking flash sale on this stock the likes of which has not been seen in history the volume of share ownership due to synthetic shares seems to be significantly larger than the volume of shares that actually exist resulting in crazy pressure that is causing the hedgerows to run media campaigns collude and generally sell their souls to recover losses knowing the financial outcome is better in the short term and whilst the manipulation continues we have a chance right now volume limits dont exist robinhood and everyone else have opened things up the power of retail is still really unknown and by the love of tehlu right now all the bloody billboards are advertising gme 9th feb 1719 feb plus senate hearing free press you say the story of an underdog being cheated in the media a movie in the worksdespite the cash going to low lives and still ryan fucking cohen at the helm hiring like a mad thing in the ecommerce sector this is not financial advice and ive been doing this for half a second but a story is being told here and personally im banking on value in the next few years plus the pride for what weve exposed tldr 
32,16,2021-02-05 21:16:06,if these hedge funds are smart they are scrambling to cover now before other hedge funds do you can make the case that gmes valuation at $40$50 is justifiable by its current cash flow assumptions so buying at these levels really isnt that retarded after all gme was trading around $20$30 on organic demand before the squeeze
200,26,2021-02-05 21:02:03,i dont have and im not afraid to say it im not holding because i have im holding because im a vindictive bitch if there is even a 0000001 chance that my holding a handful of shares of gme can hurt a hedge fund im taking that chance idgaf about the money i dropped what i could though admittedly it wasnt much but i will hold these shares until fucking doomsday and ill do it again and again and again anytime i see an opportunity to hurt short sellers and hedge funds ill take it fuck them fuck all of them ive lost more than this in a casino hell ive burned more than this on a hand of blackjack bluffing with 9 high and random spots on a roulette wheel ive dropped $50k on craps in a single day you think i care about a stock dropping i dont even like gamestop hell if i sold now the loss would be less than what gamestop would typically force trading in a game or console if the stock goes to $0 and gamestop goes tits up fuck it its only money and it was a helluva ride while it lasted if it goes to the moon cool ill buy more stupid shit i dont need or blow it on some tech assuming its ever in stock while bathing in the tears of former billionaires i dont have i have something much more dangerous a stunning lack of fucks to give and an excess of spite ill see you kids on skid row as we compete and fight over a street corner or on the moon fighting over street corners i dont care which
10,22,2021-02-05 20:54:52,how to be less retarded so im very new to this obviously yoloing on gme is fun but does anyone have advice for trying to do this stock thing semiproperly i know about not putting everything into one stock but thats about it any websites or literature that covers the basics
29,43,2021-02-05 20:53:38,this is when i believe the shorts will start covering a deep dive hi everyone apologies if this is the 2nd time youve read this my first post was mysteriously deletedbig money getting the real info removed after having meticulously researched this sub as to when the shorts expire i have discovered that all of you mostly think its friday so i have a strong feeling it will definitely be friday like you all said and i trust you putting 74k on gme today however i do feel theres a caveat as ive read it might be next week too so if its not friday itll definitely be next monday or tuesdayor wednesdaythursday maybe friday after next then if not by then it will definitely be within the week after that or the month after or at the very least within 6 months possibly 12 but could be 10 yearsdefinitely within 25 years though conservatively you could stretch that to 50 as a safe bet but to err on the safe side of caution ill say by this time in the year 2146 theyll have started covering im certain of it holllllllld

100,20,2021-02-05 20:23:00,lets have rational approach on gme first im still in 455 shares sold some calls during pumps so i already locked in $25k in gains so lets address this the squeeze weve been having imo is not a short squeeze but a mix of a fomo rally and some shorts covering and shorts opened at the top we cant deny that its not comparable to the dot com bubble because many of those companies really didnt have any value and was purely on speculation gmes point is to rally so hard to margin call the shorts but rh capped us and screwed us over is there still hope who knows next gme has to be a profitable company or show good signs of a turnaround for shorts to realize theyve had enough gainslosses and should start exiting in an attempt maybe to short at higher pt read the actual ddit has always been a value play from chewy wiki chewy was founded under the name mr chewy in june 2011 by ryan cohen and michael dathe company hired former employees and executives from amazon petsmart whole foods market and wayfair in march 2012 the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million despite losing money in its first half yearfrom 2014 to 2015 sales grew from $205 million to $423 million its not exactly bananas to bananas but you see a pattern here ryan hiring people with experience then building with his team to make a company better the reason gamestop has been on a decline has always been because of bad decisions at the executive levels if youve ever had the pleasure of working under people with actually good management skills youd know theyd mostly succeed wherever they go you can move change your job or enter a different circle of people but youll always bring yourself a person who can successfully turn around a company after getting rid of the old problems bullish im not telling you to buy or sell im not a financial adviser but jezuz yall acting like everything about this company depends in 24 hours or a week it will depend on gamestop to drive another rally whether with a squeeze or not give more attention to the earnings and gamestops road map rather than si if not a short squeeze play consider it a boring long investment your 401ks probably have gone up and down throughout the years but you didnt shit yourself each time right relax and let go of the price action you will be tempted to sell at lows you will be tempted to sell highs just to break even its your choice whether you can stomach loss potential gains or opportunity costs harder but please consider the actual company instead of just the price i got in because i believed the price was just bad sentiment and artificially driven down by over shorting lastly unless youre not meeting bills financial obligations or paying your monthly dues for the backdoor brojob wendys relax nothing has changed the outside world hasnt changed the ground that youre stepping on hasnt changed only your perception has changed stop day dreaming about massive gains or dreading about massive losses have a more stoic approach and a plan that being said im glad to have held and cried with you all even if it was for just a moment i actually saw a solidarity that didnt care about politics race or genderonly tendies and each other you lose you gain thats life but life is not only about gains and losses tldr look at other things aside from price action its been quite a ride its an honor to have been in it dont worry so much your wifes bf will take care of her while you do other things im riding this ship til gamestop develops a cure for cancer 455 shares 966
52,16,2021-02-05 20:18:04,does wsb have it in them with restrictions being lifted all over the place do you feel wsbs and the fellow monkey brained allies of wsb push on gme will continue do you think we all have it in us to make our loss porn that much more sexy or is the media correct in saying that the partys over
20,5,2021-02-05 19:50:43,can we have 2 daily separate threads for gme hi all what used to be a pretty fun community seems to have turned into a pit of toxicity people used to laugh at loss porn and losses were part and parcel of wsb the gme thread at this point is almost like a fomo sales thread where people who sold are asking other people to sell just because they dont want to be the only people who missed out if the squeeze happened can we have a positive and negative thread where the retards can continue being retarded together and the sellers can go and justify their own losses together
446,66,2021-02-05 19:46:03,why the squeeze might happen before 29 february 9th is the day the short interest report will come out for gme many have speculated that these numbers could perhaps be altered to mislead the public but it was pointed out by another user that the brokerages are the ones that report the short interest just a reminder there are brokers like fidelity who have long positions in gme over the whole week ladder attacks have taken place to drive the stock price downcould it be the hedge funds setting themselves up to cover for cheaper there is almost no way mathematically that hedge funds have covered and short interest report on 29 could be the final catalyst to trigger the squeeze however with gme at the low price it is now it is possible the hedge funds planned for this and bought way otm calls as a hedge for squeeze that way they profit too again i could be completely wrong and if this doesnt happen that doesnt change the fact that the shorts have not covered and will still be in danger even after 29 this is not financial advice
46,15,2021-02-05 19:42:36,robinhood falsifying market data see overlay pictures of candel stick graphs the data transformations in the page source of the rh advance chart of gme tldr rh is getting so desperate as to lying to us to our face now discuss here
179,45,2021-02-05 19:36:55,why im not selling gme until its hits $10  im down 80 i entered in during the big swings at around 300 gme is a $10 stock entering at $300 i knew my risk was $290 for the potential gain of thousands there is no free lunch here i was and am still willing to pay that risk selling now after close to 80 of my risk has already evaporated and paid down makes no sense for me i still have close to 100 of my potential upside but almost 90 of my downside risk has already been realized selling now is wasting that 90 already spent when it goes up from here i will have nobody to blame other than my very own paper hands 
43,7,2021-02-05 19:17:30,the drop in gamestop short interest could be real or deceptive market manipulation breakdown of how this is possible hey everyone happened across this article today and want to know if there is any veracity to it thoughts nbsp nbsp here is the real meat of the article nbsp but there is another possibility which is that the hedge fund short interest in gme didnt really dissipate nbsp if the long holders of gme shares did not break ranks and sell en masse it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time nbsp that is because without a critical mass of longside holders selling into the market the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered bought back their short positions nbsp in this second scenario though the hedge funds that are short with tens of billions of dollars on the line could have decided to play a highstakes trick nbsp the trick would be make it look like weve covered our shorts when we really havent because we cant so that short interest falls and the reddit army gets demoralized thus breaking the squeeze nbsp the way the hedge funds could have done this made it appear as if they covered their shorts even when they really didnt involves trickery in the options market the tactics involved are not a secret in fact the securities and exchange commission sec knows all about such tactics and published a risk alert memo on the topic in august 2013 nbsp the sec memo is titled strengthening practices for preventing and detecting illegal options trading used to reset reg sho closeout obligations you can read it here via the sec website nbsp and this part nbsp the memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language but heres a quick rundown nbsp if short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades nbsp a hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock meaning they are now short the call options having sold the call options to someone else typically a market maker and simultaneously buy shares against the call options nbsp the shares bought against the call options could be synthetic longs meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade nbsp this works because if a market maker buys options from an options writer the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of naked shorting as part of their hedging function this is necessary under the current rules and the current system for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades nbsp as a result of the above transaction the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls a synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasnt part of the original float the synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts legally initiated by the market maker so the market maker can hedge nbsp the hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have bought back their short position via buying long shares except they actually havent the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market makers hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund nbsp it gets very complicated very fast
22,9,2021-02-05 18:52:58,gme question serious lets say hf a shorted 10m gme shares and hf b shorted 10m gme shares can they cover their shorts in this manner 1 hf a buys 500k shares in the open market to cover its short 2 hf b buys 500k shares in the open market to cover its sort 3 hf a and hf b continuously sell the shares to each other to cover their shorts if the above theory is not true then how can the hfs short more 100 of the available stock

16,21,2021-02-05 18:03:27,possible outcome we all understand that the squeeze that happened a couple weeks ago was thanks to gme being shorted and being bet on to lose now while gme is tanking and hit lower prices surely hfs and traders will once again short gme probably double down and short even more compared to last time if this is the case if we let gme keep lowering we once again have the potential to pull of a massive squeeze one even bigger than last time am i wrong in thinking this edit read what im saying before you comment use some logic and actually discuss
8,2,2021-02-05 18:01:47,the reckoning past or future this is not financial advice you would get better advice from a third grater a bit of a psa before i proceed do you know what yolo means not the word but the intent behind the word it means taking that 20k your old man left you when he died and putting it all on gme it does not mean draining your life savings and ruining your marriage your financial future and so much more you can absolutely be a retard with your money and not be a giant fucking idiot youre not an investor if you do this youre a gambling addict now if you did this and youre really that much of an idiot all may not be lost the best thing to do is to hold and pray for a squeeze if not maybe you can hold onto it for a year or two and recoup a large portion of your losses if the stock goes up but either way you need to acknowledge that youre a fucking idiot and shouldnt be anywhere near large sums of money and the stock market now out of all the posts here giving non advice one thing they all fail to mention at the end of the day it comes down to speculation they speculate the stock is going down they speculate its going to go up they speculate these are ladder attacks nobody knows for sure what is going to happen when and how much its going to droprise final stretch as we have seen since the initial squeeze the price has been steadily declining so did we already get the big squeeze and its all over or are we looking at another the original jump to $400 i believe was a combination of short covers and reddit maniaretail buying but not all the shorts were covered these hfs can say they took billions in losses but they dont tell you that they actually havent cashed out those losses they are waiting most of them have way smarter people than you and iand likely dont mind breaking the law what appears to be happening according to every ape on wsb that can screenshot a graph is that they are applying a combination of selling shorts and ladder attacks they are doing this to drive down the price while also making money in the process with the amount of interest from reddit and every other retail investor there is no way these hfs are not throwing in every penny they can to get that price down getting normies to paper hand is just a bonus and what happens when they get that price down they are going to cover their shorts for minimal losses maybe even come out with a profit the legality of what is going on is beside the point and what happens when they stop the ladder attacks and stop shorting and cover their shorts another huge jump in stock price but when the day before we find out how much short the stock really is why well if everyone finds out they still have billions of shorts to cover its going to be a mad dash to buy as many of the stocks as people can before they cover then we will definitely know we are in a squeeze they dont want that so they are going to keep driving down the price and making money on more shorting before they cover their asses and in their mind hope that the losses will be minimal this would also explain the bailout by citadel they needed money to keep trading with to make their money back again this isnt financial advice i just heard it from the retarded monkey in my head over the screams for bananas
0,4,2021-02-05 18:00:18,lets goooo i pulled out earlier today to let gme to continue to drop robin hood removed restrictions balls deep part 2 im pulling out the 9th if the short report is less than 50
40,16,2021-02-05 17:57:30,thoughts on gme divide hey dudes just college student lurker that got caught up on the gme hype train and dropped a measly 2k 250 wanting to share my thoughts on the current split between everyone holding and everyone telling those who are holding that theyre retarded for still holding first of all were all retarded here so that doesnt need to be pointed out second of all i feel like a lot of the posts are just being fueled by bullish speculation while the posts callin out the dumbass are fueled by speculation in the other direction imagine being lmao while i am still holding and probably gonna buy more when it dips below 40 i do think that there is merit to both arguments just not when its being backed up with speculation speculation price is gonna go up cuz of feb 9 short report price is gonna go up cuz restrictions are gone price is gonna go up cuz maybe papa elon or mama chamath will drop money on it price is going down cuz the squeeze already happened at 400 price is gonna go down cuz the shorts have already covered price is going down cuz all the fucked it for everyone the point is all of these arguments are based on speculation and completely useless nobody knows how the short float report or the lifted restrictions is gonna affect the stock nobody knows whether the squeeze really did happen at 400 because the brokers fucked the momentum for the stock nobodt knows if the shorts have covered because the report hasnt even been posted yet and the last one was recorded up until jan 15 all we know is that there was clear manipulation that completely fucked the stock while it was on its way up the silver shilling and the news calling reddit for market manipulation and painting this subreddit as the culprit the brokers shutting down buying right as it was about to hit $500 before completely tanking it to $120 the sec investigation that looked into this subreddit instead of robinhood or citadel or literally any other institution that was partially responsible for closing half of the trading system all we know is that the trade restrictions have been halted and that the price is hitting or about to hit a very low and appealling price to people who were bullish on it anyway just based on its longterm fundamentals cohen and friends we know is that on feb 9 a short report is coming out that could potentially change traders opinions on the stock or 15 idk ive seen that date being thrown around on this subreddit but i cant find a source on it anywhere for the life of me and we know that the shares are still for sure being shorted whether you guys are bullish or bearish on the stock doesnt change the fact that things are happening behind the scenes and both sides have merit to their argument as long as it isnt purely based on speculation lookin at you retards tellin ppl to hold the stock cuz feb 9 is gonna be the squeeze so next time you guys are about to call someone a retard remind yourself that maybe the autist on the other side of the special needs door might be on to something but what do i know about financial advice i only like the stock lmao $gme to $20k

11,0,2021-02-05 17:50:01,what ive learned by joining the apes at the zoo wsb not an advisor just a simpy shrimp i learned a little bit by watching the craziness thats ensued since gme first trip to the moon but the first and most important rule i learned was to protect yourself not an advisor on every statement that involves stocks crucial and critical not to be liable for someone else listening to us be retarded and loving a stonk second but kinda important bit youre not sticking it to the man by buying a stock youre literally paying him to spin the wheel to see if you come up rich which leads to something else that i have picked up that everyone is stressing and cant be stated enough do not buy stock with money you dont intend to lose ive talked a friend down from putting second mortgage on their homes to buy in finally but big point research what youre buying before buying so moving forward no matter if youre buying the dip dont buy the dip waiting while lurking in the shadows snorting amcnok like a lab monkey with a ketamine addiction or any of the other crap you see flying through here remember ape strong together

99,43,2021-02-05 16:29:14,word of advice from someone who yoloed facebook ipo and watched it crash immediately after fucking hold in 2012 friends and family called me a fucking idiot asking me if i sold everytime i saw them saying it was a glamour stock and no one goes on facebook anymore news went on and on about stock manipulation and lawsuits i liked the stock i held the stock the stock is now high enough to see from the window of my g5 because no more frequent flyer bitch miles for ya boi i bought gme at 330 and bb at 20 friends family calling me stupid again i still like the stocks retail owns enough to be a problem and the clock is ticking hfs r full tilt on damage control and you cant gain selling low if you spent all your crayon money on this and sold on the way down bc you realized you couldnt afford it then i supersize with you ive been trading for years and learned a lot of expensive lessons the 1 lesson is to hold with all the degenerate strength you can muster or youll be saying shit like i shouldnt have sold and hindsight is 2020 while sitting in traffic in your 1997 dodge caravan next to your ugly spouse and filthy children the markets arent like the pee filled kiddie pool ur used to swimming in they are an ocean and sometimes people take a shit in them disclaimer i ate lead paint chips when i was young if you take stock advice from anonymous people on a public website then ur a fucking idiot like me
16,27,2021-02-05 16:20:20,explain to this autist why the hedge funds arent fucking us raw so explain to me like im dumb because i am why we dont think the hedge funds are metephorically fisting us raw why exactly is gme going to jump up it seems like the going theory is that the hedgey boys are going to have to cover their positions and its going to bump the market but i also think i see that the main reason is that they are going to have to cover at a high if not higher price than they initially shorted for but will they it seems like they already did the market fuckery while we were all holding our dicks in bed so that they can cover at a reasonable price and we already know they did the short 2 electric boogaloo right around when robin hood was corporate shilling while prices were high so wouldnt it be true that although they lost money hand over fist in the beginning they are covering the stocks sold when it was 300 beans now during a time when its just 90 bone listen im dumb as rocks but how are they not fucking us up the ass right now the way i see it they will just short this stock all the way to the floor and the only one that loses is all of us idiots who bought a meme stock at the absolute peak there is a lot going around that there must be a plot to undercut the market because if not why are they pulling such underhand fuckery with the false silver story and the online boxing us out of the trading floor we think that they are afraid of us holding but what if we dont matter any more to them than the hundred dollar bills they wipe with what if there isnt any plot to make us sell because they need us to sell what if they would just like us to sell so they get the hookers and blow earlier than next week i honestly want someone to explain why this isnt a rigged game i feel a little like a guy stealing the fresh fruit from the porno set like obviously they noticed and i got something they want but they are still getting paid to go balls deep in sasha grey so it seems like big picture not the point genuinely want to know
28,34,2021-02-05 16:17:41,whats going to be done to purge this sub of all the gme bullshit ive loved wsb for a long time now was in on the gme play from early december rode the wave and cashed out at around $300 now this whole sub is filled to the brim with people tryna justify their losses and spreading what is essentially misinformation praying that their fellow fools will hold on and dump more money in so that they can get out with at least a slice of their initial capital the reason wsb got famous is because the dd posted here was often of an insanely high quality and because the shitposting was of a monumentally high level now this has turned to shit and needs to be purged i call for a ban on all gme short squeeze related posts
230,81,2021-02-05 15:51:59,a lot of grave dancing on this sub recently important to remember a few things though there is a lot of schadenfreude going on and talking about how idiotic people were for not selling their gme at $300 but its important to remember that none of the bag holders here made a dumb decision to hold not actually they got gigafucked by the brokers when they restricted buying something nobody saw coming and was basically a totally unprecedented move and completely cratered momentum and it gave the hedge funds and shorters critical time to cover their most toxic positions to prevent complete destruction that stock really was about to then they pulled the rug right out from under everyone everyone who bought at $300 saw the evidence and jumped on the momentum they made the right choice the choice was so right in fact that they got a media wall street politicians scrambling for how to deal with it they got citadel to bail out melvin capital and they got the clearing houses and market makers to restrict selling the dd was right we were fucking the hedge funds and beating them at their own game they were caught with their pants down the main issue is that traders didnt know how long the buyrestriction would be in effect would it be restricted 1 hour 4 hours by the time they undid the restriction to an acceptable level basically today it was already too late so now the situation has turned from a get rich quick fuck the hedge funds scheme to a more traditional long play with a small chance of a short term spike if something major happens gamestop has all the attention it could have ever asked for and most of their new shareholders are likely their prime demographic that they would love to have back and now have every reason in the world to help them succeed if cohen plays his cards right and knows what hes doing he can turn gamestop into a legitimate competitor to steam a la the epic games store as well as compete with newegg if they can pivot into pc hardware culture which is a huge market that is basically totally untapped for them right now there is still money to be made in gme stock however it will more likely take a year or two or more instead of a week or two but i dont think its fair to call people idiots for getting in late andor not selling we should be sympathizing with them for getting fucked by the system so hard with blatant corruption not making fun of them its not your fault if you get cheated on even if the signs may have been there in retrospect anyway let the retards have their fun its nice to have some hope in this fucked up world every once in a while so im gonna go to gamestop first for all my gaming needs from now on and im gonna hold some gme stock not worth it to sell at this point anyway
11,29,2021-02-05 15:51:23,stimulus check is looming to all my fellow american apes we had your back when you needed to pump those rookie numbers let your inner retard go out you know that check already has a name and its fucking gme hedge funds got bailed out with tax money to fuck the economy once again what about you use your well contributed tax money and fuck them up this is not financial advice i am just another retard bananas are on the horizon we just need to double down and take them tendies

58,15,2021-02-05 15:31:35,real talk when youre left holding the bag edit tldr x200b this community is all over the place and for good reason with millions joining the sub in a matter of weeks and the single greatest meme event in wall street history theres a lot of misinformation and clouded sentiment compounded by internal politics and manipulation turn all of that off for a second and hear some real wisdom heres the dd for yall that havent been around for more than a month for credibility and backstory ive been following udeepfuckingvalue our lord and savior since july we all knew who roaring kitty was on youtube and his dd and streams were the shit go checkout his channel and youll understand where youre actually sitting at on charts hint probably holding the bag currently but dont get discouraged yet back when gme was a pitiful $4 dfv was sharing fundamentals as well as speculation that the stock was worth $5080 thats likely what the price will reflect long term however the case for a short squeeze was a bonus and really memed hard in december thats what probably lead a lot of you noobs to this sub so what does that mean for the future shorts are still high 20 short interest is considered extreme conservative and likely manipulated estimates still show interest above 50 fuck the float hype and short squeeze the reality is you dont need the hype for the obviously bullish moves coming throughout 2021 on gme most of you retards have probably lost 70 or more so theres no real reason to fret or stress about losing more anyways right instead heres what you do cost average at this current dip meaning buy more with whatever disposable income youve got its going to have support based on the 50 day moving average and fundamentals the stock should be trading at $80100 in my opinion and based on mostly fundamentals gme earnings in march are likely to make a case for positive outlook for the company to $100 and beyond through 2021 you may not see it rise to $300 this year if you bought the top but you may realize some conservative gains that net you some profits or at least break even optimistically theres still a really good chance the squeeze has a round 2 but dont count on it make the long term play if you like the company and stock and just hold learn your lessons and get better at due diligence do what makes sense for you and always do your own research yea were degeneratesretardsautists but many of us in this sub are also ridiculously smart and wear those labels ironically we just like to have fun and make stupid bets with our tendies thats the whole premise here and i dont think anyone expected the surge of idiots that just follow along blindly this is never meant to be financial advice just a place to laugh learn and love while eating shit or tendies depending on the day

11,4,2021-02-06 03:28:52,just a curious mind here so i was in a chat with a guy i know about the current gme case the hedgefunds are trying to stop people from buying stocks while the common people are buying and holding meanwhile people are saying this is a clear undermining or whatever word i should use of the free market then i suddenly got reminded that just last falldecember a lot of scalpers tried ordering tons of nvidia cards playstation 5s and xboxes then supplierers cancelled orders with more than a certain number of purchases and got almost applauded for that and that got me thinking what really is the free market and does that mean we should be able to sell and deny selling to whoever we want to just trying to understand why scalpers apparently are not allowed while stopping us from buying those stocks is also not allowed i understand why and at the same time do not cause either both should be allowed or both should not be according to my logic
20,1,2021-02-06 03:25:02,dd on naked short selling failure to deliver and short interest who didnt play by the rules first some terms skip if you know them what is naked shorting the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist this practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality you cant sell something that doesnt exist investopedia on naked shorting what is failure to deliver occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation eg i borrow shares to short sell that dont actually exist so i am unable to actually deliver the shares i am selling to a buyer investopedia on failure to deliver what is short interest the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out ie returned to the borrower investopedia on short interest how are these terms related while short interest and ftd are to some extent natural market phenomena there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest high ftd rates and the existence of naked short selling for a stock source predictors of naked short selling perhaps more importantly the above article establishes that ftds are not random occurrences and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases was there naked short selling with gme almost certainly yes gme has been on the nyse securities threshold list every trading day since december 8 meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days the sec is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations source for securities threshold list source for secs regulations moreover gme short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since december 8 average short sales 50 of total sell volume finra short volume what does this all mean it means that someones cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions and the sec didnt do shit about it ok so they cheated no surprise there what can i do about it 1 submit a tcr complaint to the sec sec complaint form 2 contact your local state and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset
30,13,2021-02-06 03:24:35,yesterday i paperhanded and sold my 15 gme shares at $55 after being hit by a major wave of fud good thing humans learn from their mistakes cause boy oh boy im back on this bitch $65 with all my 15 shares again never making this mistake again sometimes you gotta buy high and sell low so that you can buy low and never sell gme 4 life
60,7,2021-02-06 03:19:28,the squeeze just a friendly reminder that until we know the full picture on what the current short position is institutions will continue to sell off gme on what they believe is a premium todays morning rally is the result of limitations being lifted on popular meme stocks and the subsequent slide isnt so much paper hands folding as it is the institutions but while theyre selling were buying were not pumping were squeezing wsb is going to own this stock like never before be ready for the war of attrition obligatory 
57,2,2021-02-06 03:19:21,you are holding gme we are holding gme and we are buying gme again summary holdbuy to get more tendies i know you are doubting we are still all in the increase you saw at 1559 wasnt a masive buy was a masive close buy of short retailers you did your first squeeze small squeeze against retailers in that moment i feel like we was having 1 short for every 4 buy or 5 short every 20 and it turned in a few seconds to only 1 every 20 pumping our rocket to orbit again after a masive increase in price new retailer with more money started more short positions thats why you see it going down currently we are again almost 1 short every 4 they think you will stop holding and they can steal your bananas you see it down but its not us selling is they starting more and more shorts if you holdbuy they will be forced to close their positions with a buy and increase our bananas if you hold enought until some more people come to gme there will be a masive up again and short retailers will need to buy again bringing us to spaceeeeeeeeeeee the hedge funds are way far in space so we need a lot of boost to achive there we need fuel for it memes are the best fuel trust me monkeys monkey jesus talked to me in my magic ball thats where the numbers come and i throw the reverse card every time i can sorry my bad typing i am a monkey just typing random not a brokerinvestoradvicer with high studies do your own decisions on your own risk
31,1,2021-02-06 03:15:54,sike 101 regarding gme the hedge fund buddies involved fucking themselves with a dildo because i guess its fun for them they started naked shorting or just plain shorting with shares borrowed to create mass panic they raised the price to bring it down with more borrowed shares however they didnt account for the retards located her on wallstreetbets we caught wind of their shenanigans they thought wsb was made of but we are made of carbon they sold over 100 in short interest having to also pay a premium when it was time for the squeeze they put themselves in they thought it would be best to short 100 so they can at least make some folks realize their gains so the hedges can have more money and decrease their own short interest position this led to their attempt to psychologically chip away paper hands lo and behold their attempts to drive the price from $50000 pps to the $5000 would allow them to regain the shares they sold short or naked so if we hold and continue to hold their psychological attempt to make us sell would actually dig them into a deeper hole so i am holding because of so psych 101 or sike 101 we playing them well fellow apes i eat crayons and made this story out of my ass and various readings this past week

15,21,2021-02-06 02:06:28,any reason not to buy options at $001 and sell them at $002 so i recently bought a very low amount of very cheap options not expecting too much again i barely put any money into it and they recently hit $001 however this morning the stock went up a little bit still not even close to the calls price target but the call went up to $006 and it got me thinking basically is it at all a strategy to buy the lowest strike price $001 call then if the stock goes up a tiny bit it goes up to $002 and you sell the option for 100 returns i should mention i have no intent to exercise any of these i would simply sell them in addition the call does appear to be able to be worth less than $001 so as long as you dont wait until expiration day it wont be worthless or anything am i truly retarded and completely missed something or is this a valid strategy for stocks i think will be going up x200b and yes i still have my gme if you were wondering

12,19,2021-02-06 07:12:58,what exactly happened at 1000 am to cause that surge unfortunately during the one window i decided to take a shower this morning there was the immediate spike and decline of gme that could have erased by $10000 deficit and i wouldve actually made a little profit in the process it seemed a bit unnatural is that hedges unloading a slight bit of their squeeze at that moment hopefully it wasnt the rest of it heh what did seem to be the case is it occurred shortly after we hit underneath $50 ill have to look out for that again if that ever occurs

19,10,2021-02-06 06:23:27,popular interest in gme is increasing and remains strong just did a little bit of research and thought the community may benefit from the modest ramblings of a degenerate gambler like myself tldr the core idea is that gmes stock price benefits tremendously from momentum and popular interest there is very obvious evidence that the two were correlated over the last couple of weeks but i posit that they are causally related i think i have evidence of two things 1 momentum is rising 2 popular interest is rising finally i argue that momentum and interest are causally related and that the recent correlation has some underlying explanation that utilizes both points above this is not advice i just like gme i have shares and options 0212 $305c also i have no idea what im talking about feel free to correct me x200b the data 1 google trends a 2 volume a b x200b search interest stock price and volume are all correlated over the last few months and especially so in the last week it would be nice if we had finer resolution search data because we could see if the buying over the day is granularly correlated with google search volume indicates that the two are causally related the first figure in 1a shows search interest over the last month in the us with daily ticks i see a big spike when we were in the 300s last week then a sharp decline and the appearance of a recovery daily interest appears sustained elevated and growing the second figure in 1a shows hourly ticks over the last 7 days blue is the search term gamestop and red is gme i see that interest in the stock was steady between the end of last week and the start of this week if anything it peaked a bit higher on monday i also see that public interest is fading the blue line probably approximates public interest non investors who dont know the symbols however the red line is still spiking robustly which i interpret to mean that people who are actually investing in the stock are still checking it out of course there is probably a mixture of gme shareholders and nonshareholders who still use the term and you can see the baseline move a lot over time my guess is the red signal can be decomposed into at least two components the baseline mostly nonshareholders and the daily spikes shareholders i have the most confidence that the yellow line termgme stock is mostly shareholders and it appears much more constant shows a much smaller difference between last weeks peak and this weeks peak all of this leads me to conclude that interest in owning the stock is starting to become uncorrelated from the medias reporting and is actually still likely increasing 2a shows the monthly price volume and change with daily ticks 2b shows the last 5 days with minute ticks i believe that both charts show that the volume is increasing again i think this is because restrictions were lifted and perhaps because uncertainty at the beginningmiddle of the week is starting to dissipate it appears that investors were still trying to play the early morning swings this week and interest in trading the stock picked up during the week all of this supports my conclusion that buying interest among retail is recovering and setting up to spike again at the beginning of next week x200b momentum is in part generated by trading volume and sustained price movement you can clearly see in 2a that there are two phases a green phase in the beginning and a red phase after the spike green days are more likely to be followed by green days and red days are more likely to be followed by more red days at least in the short term however dynamics can shift and the trend can flip today appeared to show evidence of that flipping and i believe it indicates we are more likely to have a big green monday the morning price spikes have been getting larger over the last couple days since the restrictions are up i think these spikes will keep getting bigger and bigger through next week as momentum increases and those spikes get more reliable people will be less afraid to hold through the day and the feedback continues until short meltdown looking forward to monday but diamond hands forever
30,14,2021-02-06 06:23:07,charles schwab is the way hey guys i just want to report to you the 2 incidents i had over the course of the gme week where everybodys robin hood got totally butt fucks the 1st is on monday i could not sell my microsoft and fortunately it rebounded and i did not take a loss but for the badge experience charles schwab gave me $200 the next day my mrna that i attempted to sell would not go through and i did incur as $550 loss and had a trade dispute filed that dispute was supposed to take 30 days but it only took like 4 or 5 and they gave me the sale price of when i attempted to sell and reimburse me my $550 or whatever seriously charles schwab is the way i dont know about fidelity i have no experience but personally speaking from my experience charles schwab is good
50,19,2021-02-06 06:20:10,if people who sold at the top would buy in again the price would rocket  gme cant be shortet anymore and because of that the price isnt going down anymore its just going sideways right now so what we saw was that the price went up when the restrictions from robinhood got removed because people could buy in again so the more we buy and hold the more we decide the price so buy and the price will go up the more we make the price go up the more the short sellers and hedge funds will have to pay up and the bigger the squeeze will be fyi this is not investment advice i just like the stock tldr buy and hold the diamonds hands will be rewarded btw im retarded and blind
0,13,2021-02-06 06:19:03,the next short squeeze probably wont be gme again but when they announce the monthly short interest if any of you has a brain youll check for stocks that do have high short interest as well as preferably low float and relatively low volume low liquidity means you can scoop up the float more easily and then check to see the interest rate to borrow high interest means brokers deem it a relatively risky short either because there are few shares to short or the short price is close to what its currently at i sincerely doubt there are any stocks that have been left at risk of squeezing after the last two weeks but you never know
22,8,2021-02-06 06:11:28,naked shorting who didnt play by the rules dd on naked short selling failure to deliver and short interest who didnt play by the rules first some terms skip if you know them what is naked shorting the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist this practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality you cant sell something that doesnt exist investopedia on naked shorting what is failure to deliver occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation eg i borrow shares to short sell that dont actually exist so i am unable to actually deliver the shares i am selling to a buyer investopedia on failure to deliver what is short interest the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out ie returned to the borrower investopedia on short interest how are these terms related while short interest and ftd are to some extent natural market phenomena there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest high ftd rates and the existence of naked short selling for a stock predictors for naked short selling manuscript perhaps more importantly the above article establishes that ftds are not random occurrences and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases was there naked short selling with gme almost certainly yes gme has been on the nyse securities threshold list every trading day since december 8 meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days the sec is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations source for securities threshold list source for secs regulations moreover gme short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since december 8 average short sales gt50 of total sell volume finra short volume what does this all mean it means that someones cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions and the sec didnt do shit about it ok so they cheated no surprise there what can i do about it 1 submit a tcr complaint to the sec sec complaint form 2 contact your local state and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset
5,4,2021-02-06 06:08:19,buying pressure last time i made this post i had some pussies telling me how bad of a person i was because i was trying to tell people what to do or some shit like that idk i dont really pay to much attention to the weak butt just to be clear im not at all telling people to do this i am not a financial advisor and this should not be taken as financial advise i just put pieces together and try to make sense of it i very well may be retarded and or ill informed on the current buying pressure gme has however i am strongly not against doing anything that would benefit you in regards to inviting people to be a part of this if you catch my drift i know some people in this world just arent cut out to do what they need to do and thats fine play it safe do you i dont judge trust me right now though if any of you are still betting on gme to raise in prices just realize that buying pressure is what you need now generally speaking most people or a large group of people found out about gme through social media wether it was from post memes or social media influencers from all the big apps twitter instagram tiktok etc if you expect the stocks your investing on to increase you have get gme trending on social media again again im not telling you to invest anything in the stock market if you support the movement your doing enough by posting on social media but if you want to bring awareness to the movement going viral with gme is the wave we need to ride i think and very rarely does a ape think and also if you think that gme likeliness to go viral again are low just be aware that the bank challenge has been going viral for weeks now and we alll know about the effort theyve made to keep movements like that going so anything is possible point being get creative and tell everyone and you just might pull this off possibly it cost no money to post on social it cost $0 to post anything about gme on social media i am not telling anyone to buy more stocks this is not financial advice this is one retard speaking ape

20,25,2021-02-06 05:29:10,what i learned from the gme mania never ever invest in a stock if you do not personally believe in it no matter how attractive the potential returns may be i bet you that the people who made the most money from tesla were the ones who were just devoted to the company because of this they are able to hold the stock no matter what and ride out any negativity gme may also be a great company one day and those who stuck around will be rewarded for those who only jumped in to make a quick buck my advice is find your own stock a company you can relate to that makes products you genuinely like and has the potential to show massive growth in the next 1020 years you will see how easy it is to ignore the bullshit then and any dips will be potential opportunities to buy more
0,32,2021-02-06 05:23:34,for gme its all over but the crying todays dead cat bounce isnt going to last very long if you hold gme you should get out as soon as possible save your money for the next squeeze play i dont know who or what that will be but im looking forward to it but in my opinion gme has now jumped the shark js

0,11,2021-02-06 05:17:55,airborne wireless network abwn looking good it seems it wouldnt be hard to turn this one into a big win its worth practically nothing whats stopping people from pumping into it like they did with gme x200b edit im still learning a lot about this stuff but i dont understand why people wouldnt take a small risk on something like this with shares being so inexpensive 
20,22,2021-02-06 05:16:08,remember to be vigilant guys there are psychopaths on both sides trying to play the game but theyre playing their own game for their own benefit these people will try to break you down with anything it doesnt matter if its right or wrong they have learn to utilize fud and theyll say anything to you to get you to do what they want they arent playing by the same rules they have the ability to reduce their or numb their own fud and will take you for a ride and then discard you lastly remember for gme realise that fud fear uncertainty doubt are just states of mind depending on who raises you or who you will surround yourself with no matter what make an effort to treat each and every moment or opportunity that you may receive with a grounded perspective and objectively also be able to be your own therapist because the sooner you realize that who and what you learn will shape who you become and that nothing is inherently known or given but are rather things that come up or you will have a take on or a perspective that may not be necessarily true or valid youre human prone to error at some point thats fine so always try to see that you were being fair grounded respectable mature in all these things will help you focus and guide you into a direction that would put your life in a better position take solace that this happens to everybody there is not an individual who will not face this with yourself and your own consciousness in your mind type of feeling that you only have yourself and dont try to explain that to anybody you know be able to rationalize it to break it down to contextualize it but use it to better yourself and others please if youre like a super young person reading this or just any other person like me you may see it as themes of selfactualization third eye or vibes well thats what you shoot for as a person your parents or friendsfamily ideally would help you achieve it if they dont get new family and friends if not you may want to achieve this sooner rather than later to deal with the realities and harshness of the world or you will suffer more than you would have too rather than if you had the tools in your toolbox im only 22 and some people learn this as kids younger older some never achieve it now thats hell btw voice to text for the horrible grammar and structure

48,21,2021-02-06 05:00:48,stop thinking about gme amc bb nok in terms of the market and look at it in terms of normal human behavior the short squeeze is currently underway and is a signal that a predictable pattern of events will occur humans are predictable especially in aggregate humans are almost all the same and act incredibly similar to each other so if the pattern repeats it will repeat none of us are special i bet on gme because humans are simple predictable creatures this pattern of this event has been established there is no way around it but through and we know what that looks like gme to the moon
3561,269,2021-02-06 04:58:44,gme gamma squeeze 7 million shares left to hedge   thats probably what caused our early spike to the $95 before shorts panicked right now its a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money max pain theory says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire otm but there are 89000 call options expiring friday from $60$120 that mms will have to hedge as the price increase shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves there are another 60000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises also contributing to a gamma squeeze there are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged but im also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so ive excluded them from the main numbers these are personal opinionsmy guesses and not investment advice ive also got so much gme that i cant do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day tldr in total thats 15000000 million shares theyd have to buy today of which theyve only hedged about 3 million so far rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta thats a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice edit for the requested rocket ships 
24,18,2021-02-06 04:56:29,i love those people which came for quick buck those which bought high sold low and now they are negative af instead taking their toilet paper hands and getting the f out of here i came about 34 year ago lurking being jealous of people throwing tens or hundreds of thousands away on yolo plays while my salary is 1500$ a month i am 22 and i am currently at red 1032$ i have left 600$ from my 2 years of hard savings bag of gme and 2 aapl nobody will give me back that money here no one gives as hit how much i fucked myself did kinda a lot even if that would be like lunch money for them but i took the risk and now i am holding either to make buck or sink with the ship and regret hopping in the casino stop being mad because you bought lotto ticket threw it away without scratching the last number on it this sub was something i never experienced before when i joined but now its worse than my fb or instagram main page as far as i am aware the posts i saw years back this was always casino we will be at least bit smarter apes on next tuesday because on this gme there are actually some technicals spamming does not help hold or if you cant take it leave and hold also to make this post interesting for the soft brains on here gme 2 360 1 263 1 221 3 81
10,10,2021-02-06 04:53:07,your squeeze dd was ammunition for the big players the offense was shouted from the rooftops for the defense to counter behind the scenes and the moving of the goal posts every day decayed your holders im still convinced gme wouldve hit $1000 and beyond but the moves by retail brokerages were coordinated tactics based off of a playbook that ape gang handed them on a diamond platter for everyone that bought high and claiming diamond hands i dont think you understand the narrative youre holding for the squeeze while all the ogs are holding because its a great investment at the end of the day and can play out in the long term these are investors that bought shortly after or with dfv not at the top calling him god as someone who bought in at 112 and saw the writing on the wall and pulled some actual tendies good luck downvote me and have your fun if you bought high and are convinced any day now youre trapped in a small cave also look at the dds and dont care holding is cult level self deception look at q anyways $arkk $icln $roku long spreads all day baby
15,15,2021-02-06 04:51:00,halts are a part of regulation theres been a fuck ton of complaints about halting but understand halting stocks are necessary and part of regulation yes it sucks it kills momentum and i know youre angry but it is not just simply that the big guys are trying to fuck us over halts can happen for drastic increase and decrease in prices its just that gme prices dont usually tank at a rate of them rising so it can seem like everything is against us however they happen to insure buysell orders line up and to spread news about the situation stay calm and well get through this
1,8,2021-02-06 04:41:02,place puts against short ladder attacks i have been slowly round down my gme average of 545 6745 by placing puts against gme then selling the puts money back into gme its worked great on those days ladder attacks are crazy
20,33,2021-02-06 04:39:21,havent seen this mentioned here very much did you know that if you hold 100 shares of gme you can sell covered calls and its guaranteed risk free money by guaranteed risk free im under the assumption that you plan on holding the 100 shares anyway no matter what suppose you buy 100 shares of gme right now at $63 per share then you sell a 21221 $150 covered call using those shares as collateral for $720 could have sold for a lot more earlier today you now have $720 no matter what happens this is your money now you can do whatever you want with it your worst case scenario assuming you want to keep the shares is that on market close on 212 gme closes over $150 the call you sold will get assigned and you will be forced to sell your shares at $150 so you will receive $15000 for your 100 shares math $15k $720 $6300 $9420 net profit even before gme started more than half of wsb thought if a covered call you sold was assigned you just lost the shares and didnt get any money for them at all so if you still dont understand this thats okay think of it this way if you sell a call for more than the price you paid for the stock eg buy at $63 per share sell a $65 call you cannot lose any money it is literally a guaranteed gain this doesnt factor in commissions but if you are on a broker charging commissions then this isnt for you if you decide to do this and afterwards gme skyrockets youll yourself down potentially over 1000 on the call you sold dont worry about it just dont buy it back
58,52,2021-02-06 04:34:02,i put all my money into gamestop i heard about gme and that it was a good stock to have if you want to become rich quick so i sold my car pooled all of my savings and bought gme shares with all the money i own needless to say i got fucked big time bought in at 260 i have no knowledge about how the whole trading thing works and now ive lost everything wont be able to pay my mortgage and will soon be homeless does this sound familiar to you i bet it does because since this whole thing started ive been reading posts like this all over every platform how fucking dumb can you be i mean tough luck but then again why would anyone gamble all their life savings away like that i know the whole get rich quick thing is eating away peoples brains but thats just another level of stupid only invest what you are willing to lose thats the only rule you should follow one rule and people are failing what a mess edit for the people who dont get it i did not do this i am not that dumb hundreds of people did thou and thats the point
78,42,2021-02-06 04:31:06,this sub used to be my favorite and now its just annoying everyone on here is just jerking the other off for holding gme and its like a freaking orgy with shitposts can we get back to refreshing new dd and get excited over other stocks too
7,23,2021-02-06 04:30:35,what wallstreet bets has become for better or worse it to be determined however it cannot be denied wallstreet bets has become host to a social movement as you can see between the divide of amateurs ogs paper dicks and diamond balls this social movement is not necessarily defined by any one resolution within every social movement there are sub communities with their own goals and ideas but what ties all these subdivisions together is a strive for advancement and a common home for identity take a moment sit back and really take in what has been accomplished here whether you have been here years or weeks retarded or just slightly autistic you are apart of a beautiful moment of history as i see it our common cause is obtaining equity regardless of your opinions of the players of wallstreet or wealth in general everyone here have been trying to create equity for themselves in a broader society that favors the institution over the individual this is the american free market this is the evolution of democracy this is the attempt to democratize wallstreet apes strong together is the war cry of any union around the world when the first squeeze occurred robinhood answered by restricting buying and preventing any more price increase wallstreet has shown time and time again they can change the rules when they lose the legacy of the diamond hands union is their attempt to reassert the retail investor as a player into a game not made for them this union did affect the price you saw that today the trading restrictions were lifted and more diamond hands bought the stock value increases the demand went up and therefore the value goes up this is what mark cuban was talking about he never said it was a good idea to buy but by buying the diamond hands union can be a test of the power this union has i would say forcing a stock up over $20 in 20 minutes is a lot of power this is not about gme i like the stock too i like how gamestop actually seized this moment to expand their business options but it about fighting for change in a rigged system i am holding because people did not die for this country so i could live off my wifes boyfriends merrill lynch salary it was to keep the fight alive so even if we are doomed for failure i will continue to hold to keep that fight alive so my son can one day lose all of his life savings on a wallstreet bet because of his own stupidity and not because some mosquito prick like robinhood changed the game tldr this is not financial advice obviously i just learned how to write yesterday better git gud at sucking your wifes boyfriends cock when you lose all your life savings edit some helpful einstein ape taught me about paragraphs and emojis always learning always holding

71,32,2021-02-06 20:50:49,the truth about gmefrom a long time member of the sub there are people on this subreddit current orchestrating a gme is over campaign these people are complete bad faith actors and totally unethical let me explain they dont believe in the the whole idea that the price will sky rocket due to shorts being covered they lied to you and then sold at $500 when the stock was pumped up leading to its downfall they saw this entire thing as a pump and dump the whole time now that they made their money they are annoyed that their are people who actually believe in the myth of a secondpossibly larger squeeze you are literally talking about the same thing they were a couple weeks ago now they are acting as if you are retarded for talking about it this is morally corrupt hypocrisy on their part now they want to shut the sub down and stop the millions who joined from discussing this idea which very well could still happen yes people who sold gmei say this as someone who never put a cent into it you are correct it doesnt take some high iq or knowledge in investing to realize that hype and trailing hedge funds drove the price to $500 but this wasnt the original speculated reason for the short squeeze that was hedge funds needing to cover shorts on a stock that was over 100 shorted we still have the price $50 above what the price was when they sorted the stock if they havent covered their positions another short squeeze could still occur you can not prove otherwise anybody asking for the removal of gme posts because i want my sub back or idiot apes dont realize the squeeze has squoze are ignorant immoral bad faith actors they already sold and are out for them the whole thing was a pump and dump do not listen to these arrogant people edit dont let immoral ignorant people tell you its not decide for yourself

13,4,2021-02-06 07:40:43,gme review short term prediction  disclaimer i am not a financial advisor i am not your financial advisor i am merely an idiot behind a keyboard with zero stake in the game who has watched the gme situation over the past couple of weeks hard truths anyone who bought in at $300 is an idiot sorry if that caused any offence but it is true the riskreward at that buy in is too much in the risk category if the stock hits $1000 then after taxes you will only increase $350 per share a mere doubling of value however it hadhas a long way to go to reach that and it more likely especially with action taken by the short sellers to drop from there losing your stake you are quite literally going double or nothing $1000 the hope $10000 the dream $6942069 the meme note that those who bought in at sub $50 and were just buying the dips to increase their volume and lock the short sellers out of being able to settle the account are not complete idiots provided your average value is still sub $100 then you are still in a good riskreward area optimistic view the millions of units which continue to be traded out of hours is a sign to me that the short sellers are driving the share price down by buyingselling low amongst themselves driving the price down has two major benefits for them share value drop will scare off new investors and open up more opportunity for buying back the oversold stock the daily interest payments on $50 are significantly lower than those at $500 which means that they are able to hold on to their shorts for a much longer period of time pessimistic view the short sellers have closed out their position and the short squeeze has already happened likelihood of this happening is low considering the volume of trade after hours driving the price down but we will not know until tuesday short term prediction on monday the price will continue to drop down to around $3040 per unit tuesday when the short interest is revealed the price will react accordingly if there is high short interest it will jump again if it has indeed closed out then the price will continue to fall buying it a small stake at $3040 on monday would be a gamble but it has a much better riskreward lose 50 or potentially increase 1600
0,0,2021-02-06 23:22:35,before you decide to write a post about how gme bagholders are done or should sell come here first we get it big brain and big gainz dick boy squeeze is over but why should the bagholders sell opened up a position a 300 relax think about that money as something you wont be touching in the next few years the fundamentals and absolute sheer ridiculous marketing gme has benefited from this last few months are a great indicator of how this company has the biggest upside since its birth you also think that a billionaire that grew a business from 0 to a 40bn$ cap market from fucking selling dog food would invest in a company to engage in money laundering look at him he looks like such a doll you think hed invest in a dying brick and mortar type of business if he didnt have plans to absolutely turn around the whole company why would excellent amazon executives join him on the ride on top of that theres also the new revenue shareholding deals with microsoft new generation of consoles that just came out and a brick and mortar structure that can still be used with new perspectives the evaluation of gme is still uncertain at this current point in time but the future tells us this has a bigger growth potential then ever before excluding the squeeze ryan cohen is a master in ecommerce and with all of this publicity gme is and will be now in everyones mind revenues will most likely see a great growth so before you decide to make a post to tell everyone how this is completely dead business go back put a bean in your ass sit down and shut the fuck up this is not your concern anymore to the deep bagholders if you can drop your average cost the lowest possible and maybe in 3 years or so you might recover more than half of your losses dont do it now though wait for tuesday wait until this clears out and see what picture is being drawn regarding gmes future as an ecommerce company im not a financial adviser i dont even know how to make a toast so dont follow my opinion

0,43,2021-02-06 08:02:16,im sorry but what did you expect this time is different is it though short exposure aside was gme different from spcedkngnklapltrnio etc like all those situations we saw a huge run up only to be sold off a little over a week later did limitations affect the price sure but now theyre lifted and nothing changed hedgefunds can cover or at least recoup losses from buying and selling all those crazy otm options just feels like this is another day on wallstreet where little guys fought and lost interest a few days later who really won here the guys that lost life savings and morgatges did wsb really stick it to the hedgefunds
111,22,2021-02-06 07:58:10,hey apes this is super easy instead of telling us diamond hands all how wrong we are short gme now and put your money where your mouth is those of us who still hold are about to reach the moon  these hate gme guys are all full of lip service but guaranteed are too chicken to short gme now if you are so bulliiesh on gme why not buy some shorts and put your money where your mouth is im holding 589 shares forget the haters 
5,72,2021-02-06 07:56:22,can someone explain the hold gme mentality so im kind of aware of the reason gme shot up hedge funds had it shorted bla bla bla so the stock shoots up way higher than it is worth and we fuck over these hedge fund douches ok got it but why do i keep seeing posts to hold gme the price is way higher that its worth what is the point or strategy behind holding something that isnt worth its current value
13,14,2021-02-06 07:55:02,for your reading pleasure an autist loss story ready for this super autist moment incoming had two gme $115 calls 129 sold one for 20k midday friday and held the other til 358 as i go to sell in etrade power on my computer in portfolio view it times me out for inactivity before i could sell before expiration i had been clicking around so not sure why i immediately sign back in and go to sell the last one i had i hit trade from my portfolio and send submit the order i am amped that i got another 25k more at the end of the day well to my surprise when you open a trade order from your fucking portfolio it automatically goes to buy instead of sell why the fuck does it function like that in portfolio view when i can open a quote for a buy therefore i ended up buying a second $115c 129 with 30 seconds left in the market immediately after i noticed i was on the phone with etrade for 3 hours on friday while having a panic attack they said they wont know what happens til monday i look monday and they exercise the calls for way above market value 217ish a share its monday morning and now own 240 shares at this point my etrade account says my cash is $20k owed to etrade via margin i go to sell at market open to make up that 20k and hold the rest but it says if i sold those newly acquired shares id get a 90 day ban since those sharescash hasnt processed yet since i dont want to get locked out of my account for three months i have to sit on those shares until tuesday get an email tuesday morning saying the money is due tuesday well as you know it drops almost $200 a share into tuesday and i essentially sold for a loss at $120 a share i still have 60 shares left over and they are certainly not doing well either would have loved to use the money to tip some of my favorite local businesses a grand here and there but instead just gonna stuff my face with comfort food thats it boys let me have it still holding my 60 with diamond hands because tldr waited for last second friday to sell my 129 $115 call e trade logs me out for inactivity log back in with 30 seconds left think i sold my call turns out e trade auto populates a trade as a buy they exercise with margin 20k wont let me sell without 90 day ban monday wake up to email saying i owe them the money tuesday have to sell at $120ish could of had $50k have nothing
19,29,2021-02-07 02:51:04,follow the food steps of our lord and savior dfv nothing has changed since the time when dfv started accumulating shorts havent covered gamestop is pivoting to a successful tech company the last weeks pump has given us data points on what the squeeze would be 1 we keep doing what we were doing in the last few months and it scared melvin shitless 2 the actual short squeeze will be much much higher than $500 remember what we did before melvin crying to his citadel big daddy remember how we got there remember why you put money in gme in the first place
0,65,2021-02-07 01:30:17,elon musk is no tony stark elon musk south african is just an early investor who invested 6 million he had won selling his paypal stocks months after tesla was created by eberhard and tarpenning americans elon likes to take credit for tesla and the tesla vision and mission but he had nothing to do with its creation in 2009 elon used his lawyers to force the original founders eberhard and tarpenning through a lawsuit that elon won with his power where he was granted the right to call himself a cofounder as well no wonder he supported trump he is just like him he likes to take credit for things he did not even create he is no tony stark he is just a bully investor who stole the credit from two american engineers he has used his persuasive tacticts to accumulate a cult of young minions that have invested all their savings in a company that produced losses until 2020 in 2020 tesla had a positive net income for the first time since it was founded the 2020 net income was a microscopic 721 million which is nothing compared to the tens of billions that honda and toyota made in 2020 based on car sales it is worth 12 billions tesla is recalling a big portion 130000 of its cars while it only produces 500000 a year that forced elon musk to appear on instagram this week to persuade his brainwashed young investors to buy the dip he is a master manipulator young investors will get burned and he doesnt care tesla is a bubble it will make many investors lose a lot of money see gme individual investors got burned really burned while hedge funds made hundreds of millions in profits hedge funds are already pulling out of the tesla bubble all the naive investors will get hurt again when tesla collapses tesla has not grown in a month it already achieved its peak weeks ago and has been declining you should realize your gains ford and gmc are making better and cheaper electric vehicles than tesla ford and gmc will lead the ev market in one year europeans are no longer buying tesla tesla was not even in the top 2 evs bought by scandinavians last year the company was productive for many years but it already reached its peak there is no more room for bubble growth the cyber truck failed thats why it is not out yet it is all a frenzy many scientists have always had their credit stolen by bullies throughout history this is just another example gmc and ford will dominate the us ev market tesla does not even have repair tesla shops to handle the recalls tesla has to get into agreements with local repair shops to fix that mess tesla is not space x elon did not just bully the real tesla founders he also bullied his employees and they took him to court judge rules in favor of employees
16,2,2021-02-06 08:18:20,look after yourself this weekend relax and dont let the fud bug you weve all been watching with sweaty diamond hands all week so make sure you take some time to recharge nothing is going to change over the weekend that you cant catch up on monday morning so unplug and go get some fresh air gme ended today in the green were holding the line im sure there will be lots of fud shitposting shills and bots coming to attack us in the coming days so try your best not to let it get to you were in this together and while we might not see this rocket ship take off next week ill keep holding on because i love this stock and i believe in gamestop im excited to see what happens in the following weeks have a good weekend yall 
18,54,2021-02-07 04:23:34,dont be smug please friends guys lets be honest we entered uncharted territory yes we got fucked who knows what happens next but please stop with the teacher ogprofessional i told you so bulshit nobody knows a fucking thing here if on monday gme goes to 10000 many experts will post that they knew and were right with vw short charts if it goes to 004 the same shit experts will post the same chart with the peak last thursday ok some people sold and got rich some held and got stuck but none of us know a fucking thing the whole power of this shit is the momentum its gone global for sure the system will cut us and we have barely any chance but fuck it i got in just for this reason full disclosure i only have 3 shares but now that its so cheap i might buy more even if to just reduce my average i mean if you bought 3 150 then buying 10 more at 69 means i lost less p this is retarded logic i know
76,33,2021-02-07 04:00:56,why im holding for starters i only have about 3 shares at this point at an avg of 200 people seem to be attacking people still holding gme i get that theres a good chance of losing almost all of it i dont care worst case scenario i lose most of my money and i get to laugh at myself for being a dumbass who invested in a meme thats a win best case scenario it takes off to the moon and i get to laugh at you fucks and the hedge funds thats a mega win its like yall forgot that this sub is based on a ton of loss porn and a handful of huge payoffs from high risk plays
0,38,2021-02-07 03:56:27,addressing an elephant in the room hey i was dumbish and bought gme $90$200 a share believing the stock would logically go up after the weekend and that you wouldnt just have a giant sell off immediately on monday obviously this didnt happen the people who claimed to hold were simply manipulating the market in their own right so the stock price would go up and then they would mass sell this is legally fine since they said its not financial advice and used a meme to hide it but is also pretty much pump and dumping without outright being able to be charged with it as the stock dropped i sold and you know what it prevented me from being $700 in the hole because i saw the writing on the wall right now im only $200 in the hole now there was no hedgefund short ladder attack or whatever it was redditors selling simple as that truth is the diamond hands thing was market manipulation by reddit to drive the price up of a stock so those that bought it cheaper can sell they got their money while most of you got your dick in your hand and the feeling that you held the line looking back on it it was obvious this was gonna happen and although this a meme sub i am not gonna feel bad if dfv gets dragged through the legal ringer since he encouraged so many people to hold while claiming it was gonna hurt hedgefunds and be a political thing when both of those were an absolute lie he deserves whatever comes to him unjustly or not wallstreet i doubt even got hurt by this either yeah they lost $70 billion dollars in two days but they still are gonna get bailed out by the government and mark my words the hedgefunds that were hurt by this arent gonna be hurting next year they will be back because they are run by multibillionaires with 40 years of influence and experience in this stuff it was a rough year but not a bad one what my opinions are on gme if gamestop becomes the next netflix for gaming then thats the only way i can see any of us getting our money back i hope for some of you that were tricked into buying gme during the hype that this happens so you can get your money back i have 3 shares left i plan to hold in case this happens but im not holding my breath on it it could be years tell that happens long story short we got played hard and now its time to just wait and see if the new people gamestop has on board is able to rocket the company back to over $200 a share its possible imo also what i was able to get out of this is to play the stock market smart and never bend into fomo hedgefunds cant be hurt economically and this is proof they rule the money
184,46,2021-02-07 02:23:37,if were all betting on gme why dont we tell them how to succeed as a 30 year old gamer im always looking for a deal and to purchase my next game every time i go to gamestops website its high prices and no value so i often go to ebayamazon to buy used since gme cant understand that foot traffic is the way to get customers to spend more so lets tell them what it would take for them to increase revenue 1 used games should be slightly more than ebay amazon used going to get the game you want off the shelf has value and none of us care about the extra $5$10 2 used games why the fuck arent you doing this partner with stadia and rent games tons of mmos and stuff i never touch bc i hate buying games and regretting it 3 deals selling 2 properly priced used games to get me in the store to preorder a game is smart sell me on the value 4 website your website has been the same for years i used to go to it for upcoming releases provide good lists and recommendations traffic 5 incentivise employee ive never seen a salary worker work hard without an incentive give them things to do and reward them stop asking me for a warranty on my games know who did that radioshack look where they are 6 imagine if gamestop was the only place that wasnt getting hit with bots when selling the ps5 walmart is bc they dont care but just imagine how much more business they get idk those are 6 things id do if i was ceo hopefully the chewy guys can turn this ship around
1,52,2021-02-06 18:25:03,when to get out an ask for the ogs i know this is your sub i know that the gme gang infiltrated it and it sucks im sorry but i would love advice from some of you all whom have all made dire mistakes as well im calling for those of you who werent in the gme shit i had an average cost of $75 with about 74 shares i saw it get to $150 and about sold i saw it hit 250 350 450 etc and never sold until it bounced back to 90 and finally gave in yall who are criticizing people who held but it honestly seemed like it was going to keep going and going and going im not trying to mitigate my mistakes i got greedy and it screwed me what im asking is how do you go about selling because i also saw the stock dip from 440 to 129 to only bounce back up to 325 15 hours later stop losses were also not an option because again the dip from 420 to 126 and back to 300s showed that wasnt an option either idkif i would have sold at 150 on monday i know i would be kicking myself for not waiting until the 450 and i know now that i sold at 90 i didnt originally sell at 150 any clarity would be much appreciated

10,18,2021-02-06 09:43:46,a case for gme long buildapc im gme long and if you must know why im confident in the company its build a pc kiosks the console cycle has been getting longer and longer and its up to 8 years now 4 years into the cycle and thats conservative l budget gaming pcs at a price point of 500 are going to be even with the current gen consoles and outstrip them after that buildapc kiosks provide an outlet for console gamers to get into pc gaming gamestop powerup can be used as a vehicle to provide incredible discounts to buildapc customers that hook them before they have a chance to look at steam the console gaming market is 10x the pc gaming market if they convert 10 of console gamers theyll have a larger proportion of the market than steam and they have 8 years to do it they have a partnership with microsoft meaning users probably get a great discount on windows which if youve ever built a budget gaming pc is 20 of the cost they can set up their own relationships with hardware distributors to get around scalpers incentive for people who build pcs and to get bulk discounts on hardware combine that with a willingness to sell at a loss like consoles do and they could probably be at console parity in a year if not right now they dont need to compete with steam thats retarded theyre competing with _consoles_ hard now early into the cycle which they profit immensely from i might add but the longer and longer this cycle lasts the easier and easier it will be 4 years from now if they have captured just 10 of the console market at its current value thats a revenue of 6 billion not even counting the revenue from actually building the damn pcs if you count the growth of the gaming market its probably closer to 10 if they dont manage to retain a single customer with their existing model and only manage to capture 10 of the console market that gives them a share price of 150 at a ps ratio of 1 low end for sp500 if rc does for pc gaming what he did for dog food 10 is very conservative he just threw down 170 million dollars to bet on it the one question and the only question is can ryan fucking cohen find a way to market pc gaming to console gamers 4 years into the console cycle when the next gen is still 4 years away so it comes down to do you think rc can do it i do so im gme long if you dont think he can or if you think console gamers will still be fucking the cooling vents of their consoles with their micropeens 4 years from now then youre not bitches see you at $500 in 4 years hf please keep shorting i like my discounts
25,24,2021-02-06 09:43:06,just watched gme hit 300 like 5 times maybe a stupid question but on my tda gme just jumped from the 60s to 300 like 5 times for a few seconds just wondering what causes that
60,31,2021-02-06 09:40:27,disable margin on your account to stop the shorts from borrowing your shares if you have margin enabled the brokerage automatically lends your shares to the shorts when this happens the shorts use your own shares against you and you dont even know it this needs to become a campaign if you dont borrow money from the brokerage to buy shares if you dont do short sales and if you dont trade options you should disable the margin feature to prevent your brokerage from lending your shares to the shorts when your shares are lent to the shorts you dont even know it happened because your account still shows those shares as if they were still held by the brokerage whereas the shares are long gone you can invest $100000 into gme but your brokerage will lend them all to your enemy to be used against your long interests we are spinning our wheels here trying to bring the price of $gme and $amc back up the more of those shares we buy the more of them are lent to the short sellers this is insanity stop the shorts from being able to borrow your shares people
41,19,2021-02-06 09:37:31,current dd on gme and the liquidity of the share the retail investors have an impact otherwise gme would already be back at $5 stocks and buy hold still the best dd nothing has changed since that perfect dd from weeks ago shorts are not covered or only partially covered the gme dd from weeks ago already said that they will try everything to manipulate media price and also your morale unfortunately they have already managed especially the latter well yesterday many of you have already given up but the fact is if we continue they will have to cover everything at some point you see huge swings up and down despite comparatively small volume that is due to the low liquidity of gme shares there are few shares available as most are holding therefore small purchases sales have a very strong impact on the price google liquidity in the stock market or read gerd kommers books for example someone in this sub has shown on the chart how a shortseller during a ladder attack was able to lower the price by over $100 with only 250 million capital stoploss triggered etc today it was even more extreme with a few thousand shares you could liftpress the price by 10 in no time all this speaks for the low liquidity and thus for the fact that the squeeze is still possible tldr buy hold as said from the beginning not a financial advisor edit example for low liquidity so called ladder attack on wsb 
48,41,2021-02-06 09:33:55,enough is enough i wont sell this past week ive been the recipient of such intense hate and harrassment gme has gotten personal im not doing it for the money im doing it for the movement i wont sell

6,2,2021-02-06 09:06:28,a humble autistically retarded proposition ive mostly lurked here for about half a year but only recently noticed that there appears that grumbling among the unwashed masses of wsb concerning returning to normal and returning to the pregme roots of wsb or even forgetting about gme none of the above are possible first the vast majority of us here are not normal and the forum was never normal second third it is impossible to go back to the pregme days of wsb for obvious reasons too much attention shills bots and other fuckers yea i know many fantastic retards have joined the ranks also war has changed us all while some have deserted the front lines most are still fighting bravely including myselfholding my 25 shares bought at $262 lol and waiting for payday to buy some more however it may be more realistic to if other stocks are purchased while this thing is ongoing to promoting the buying of equal or greater amounts of gme that is if a retard is unwilling or unable to commit to gme 100 this may in the long run boost moral and calm people psychologically this whole thing may take weeks to run its course and we need as many soldiers as we can muster up for the cause what are your thoughtsanyoneif this post is even read by others ps im a retarded financial advisor but the above is not financial advice
21,5,2021-02-06 09:01:01,gme holding through the squeeze is just as important as holding through the dip alright fools you diamond handed apes have done a hell of a job holding so far im proud to have lost my ass with you denying melvin his shares is hard but satisfying work but the next few weeks is the real test any gamma or short squeeze has only one relief valve more shares you marvelous bastards didnt sell at $400 and you didnt sell at $50 and ifwhen the squeeze hits you have earned your tendies the thing is selling early is a bad thing and means you are letting melvin groucho and harpo off cheap when the green tsunami rolls into town think long and hard about when you want to sell think about all the shady big money interests along the way who have worked against you likely colluded and are ready to rob you of your future for the chance to maintain the status quo them on top think long and hard about how much pain they caused each of us not just this week but our entire lives how long will you hold i know fuck all about finance and stonks not financial advice ianal gme

296,44,2021-02-06 08:57:14,why the sec short interest report on the 9th is already priced in and we will see the squeeze next week  everyone is waiting for the sec short interest report report coming out on february 9th however that report will not be accurate according to current situation reason 1 the settlement date for that report was on january 29th meaning anything from the feb 1 til now is not included so what happened leading up to the 29th on the 28th robinhood and other brokers restricted purchasing of shares collusion or not it sent the price plumetting to sub 200 situation was great for the shorts to cover their positions a bit and make their report kosher price recovered a bit on friday after some purchasing was allowed however by this time the shorts already fixed their books to not get in trouble 2 now that the 29th has come and gone and the hedgies had something to hand over to the sec they started doubling down starting from monday everyone noticed the aggressive short ladder attack and more shorts were being done 3 prices have plunged from $325 close on the 29th to $5350 by close thursday 24 the reason why they can do whatever they want is that the next settlement date for the report is on friday 212 so the real important date is the 12th what to expect 1 the report on the 9th will be good to please the sec everything will point to 0 manipulation media and jimmy chill will be jerking off to the news and telling your wife to leave you 2a the report on the 9th will cause fud and drive prices lower because everyone and the media will think that you apes are retarded shorts will cover and get out of their positions easily as price has dipped way back down 2b if 2a does not happen and if everyone has diamond hands expect 210 212 where the short squeeze happens why those dates because the next settlement date for the sec report is the 12th and the hedgies have to make their report whole like how your wifes boyfriend makes her tldr gme will if you short interest report on the 9th will seem legit obligatory not financial advice i just like the stock

57,10,2021-02-06 08:47:19,if anyone is losing faith and thinks that the squeeze has been squire food for thought the fact that theres been consistent aftermarket trading of gme proves the hedges are up to some shit im not a market analyst so i dont have any fancy graphs or articles i dont know any of this technical shit you guys keep posting what i do know is that before this whole thing happened gme barely had any after market activity if at all but ever since january when all you retards and autists united activity has been going crazy but the volume is relatively low i understand that much thats enough to tell me that theres some shady shit happening and where theres shady shit theres money i want my money squeeze these fuckers 20 gme bought $34 this is not financial advice edit forgot the obligatory

40258,3571,2021-02-06 08:39:28,analysis on why hedge funds didnt reposition last thursday why they didnt cover on friday and why they want you to think they did gme fellow apes i have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the rh shutdown i have done some analysis and would like to shares my results this is not investment advice and should not be construed as such i know you guys cant read but i highly recommend learning how to read and reading this part 1 what happened on the 28th as we all know last thursday on the 28th rh and other brokerages disabled the purchase of gme shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze this is a significant day because it broke momentum and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis here is a tweet from ihor s3 stating the short interest data as of the 28th per s3 short interest was 629m as of the 27th and 578m as of the 28th the net si is 578m629m 508m this means the net short position reduced by 508m shares however many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down well lets say thats what happened and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly we will also assume this happened in a vacuum ie retail did not contribute to any volume so that we can get a liberal estimate to establish a short position at a higher price hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $48285 if the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling than they would have opened 158m more short positions 10m in volume happened in the first 10 minutes so at best they would have 10m more shares sold short between $275 and $350 and the remaining 58m positions would be opened between $350 and $480 this means that if shorts added to their position at this time the best they could have done is add 158m short positions at an average $300 this is assuming no covering was done during this period of time which is highly unlikely considering the price went up now during the freefall following rh trade restrictions there was only 104m in volume if hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price they would have only been able to cover 104m positions and 57m of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300 only 47m could have been between $300 and $112 this is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time and it doesnt even account for that fact that covering would drive the price up not down lastly after the nosedive there was a bounce of 92m in volume if we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average they would only be able to add 92m at an average of $250 once again however adding positions would have drove the price down not up so even in the most ideal situation using rhs restrictions and ignoring market mechanics shorts would have only been able to add 25m ideal short positions at an average of $280 while covering only 104m at exorbitant costs this likely didnt happen for several reasons first s3 reports that short interest decreased by 5m on the 28th now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading however they would be at nonideal prices second this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass the price would increase not decrease and when shorts sell en mass the price would decrease not increase third this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother also highly unlikely given the hype at the time fourth in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share and we know that at that time gme was hard to borrow what is more likely is the inverse of the above which would mean shorts covered 158m shares at an average cost of $300 then short sold 104m shares at an average of $250 before further covering 92m at an average of $250 despite ideal circumstances that is not an ideal result for hedge funds that means hedge funds are not kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points that would be impossible part 2 what about last friday now this was an important day gme fought hard and closed at above $320 what makes this day confusing however are the claims that short interest drastically decreased here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis here is a tweet from s3 claiming short positions decreased by 30m shares by the end of friday now i wont get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question you can look into those on your own what i want to go over is how could it be remotely possible s3 claims 31m shares were covered on the 29th however the share price had a net decreasing trend there were only 2 notable upward rallys and combined they only account for 24m shares if hedge funds covered the whole 24m in volume it would still be 6m shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves where did the other 6m shares go i find it hard to believe they could cover 6m shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday also note that short volume was 176m on friday so on friday there was 50m in volume 176m of that volume was due to shares sold short so si would be 578 si as of the 28th176m shares sold short 754m in order for short interest to have decreased to around 27m as s3 said it would have required the covering of 754m27m 484m shares how do you cover 484m shares when there is only 50m volume and 176m of that volume was used to add short positions there simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31m shares at most 324m shares total could have been covered if every single purchase of gme was by a hedge fund with a short position which would make si 754m324m 43m it is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor insider or institution purchased gme shares on friday so the actual si is likely much higher furthermore i want to draw attention to other times shares were covered and their effect on the price and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31m net shares last friday s3 claims that from jan 12th to jan 14th the si went from 69m to 62m a decrease of 7m shares on the 12th gme was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43 an 100 increase they then claim that from the 14th to the 25th there was a slight steady increase in si as the share price crawled towards $50 from the 25th to the 27th there was literally exponential growth in the share price despite no change in si but then all of a sudden on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5m short positions and a significant reduction in price and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31m shares along with a steady decline in price how could that be remotely accurate there was 50m in volume on the 29th how could the purchase of 31m shares by a single entity not even accounting for retail result in a net decrease in share price part 3 how could they do it read this post and the sources within it in detail shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered when they have not there were $43m worth of mid march 800c purchases you do the math why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday why is the media still aggressively spreading fud why are there bots everywhere in wsb shorts havent covered they cant cover and they wont they also did not shift themselves into an advantageous short position last thursday there was only 19m in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances they want you to think they covered they also want you to think they have a better short position they want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to if there were they would have repositioned on thursday brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldnt find the shares to cover nor could they find enough shares to reposition they really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail tldr seriously read this whole thing i know you wont but do it hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the rh fiasco last thursday it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts they also did not cover 31m shares last friday it would have been impossible based on volume alone they want you to think they did they need you to but they did not disclaimer i am not a financial advisor nor am i licensed or in any way

0,44,2021-02-07 09:01:45,mad respect to dfv butadvice to all gme out there honestly i have high respect for dfv he has more balls than i do that being said my advice here is for all the rest of the gme basically you have an end point coming soon so you need to plan accordingly im not gonna tell you what to do but just to give you a heads up dfv has half of his position in gme as call options expiring in april dfv has two options 1 sell those call options before expiration 2 rollover said options if he chooses one which will most likely happen anywhere from now till march hell be good if he waits for april those options will be destroyed by time decay and be worthless at expiration so if i had to guess mid march if he chooses to act the latest now if he chooses number two that would be fucking insane why would you rollover which will guarantee you losing money when you are so far ahead what you do with this infothoughts is up to you just plan accordingly good luck

16,9,2021-02-06 10:05:08,the many tactics of those in power and why they own your wife first they called wsb many names greedy selfish insane gambling addicts colluders apes and even extremists that may be associated with the capitol insurgents second they released articles saying the shorts have been covered and that hedges have exited their positions third they released articles saying silver is the next target of wsb through divideandconquer distraction and diversion tactics they made wsb to seem to invest in a boatload of other things when its only gme that mattered the eventual increase in share price of the other stocks pale in comparison and so could be treated as a loss as long as gme losses are minimized fourth they made your wives fondle rhs etoros and other brokers balls to restrict and limit trading and to outright sell your shares without your consent or even knowledge fifth they infiltrated the sub and spammed nonsense to cast doubt and division among wsb and the reddit community sixth they probably artificially inflated ala premature ejaculation the share prices in order to cull the paper hands and gay bears right after this they restricted the trading to further dampen the losses then they plummeted the share price to drive home the fact that you shouldve sold around 300 and now people are panicselling at a super low price hence people fighting now and shitcalling wsb seventh in line with six they probably paid a loss forward by buying a lot of shares spiking the share price and then selling them all off and buying back triggering a chain reaction among retail investors eight theyre fearmongering by tying dvf to a palisade and setting it on fire ninth theyre showing off your wives to the sec
1,10,2021-02-06 09:59:43,more big media fear mongering im fairly new here and new to this stock just bought 5 shares today but i saw something today that was too coincidental to ignore my wife had adult swim on and they were playing the episode where dale peggy and minh souphanousinphone follow bill around and bet on stocks based on what people like him buy they end up gaining a ton of money initially but then when he knows they are observing him in this way it stops working because he feels pressured and their golden goose is no more i thought the timing of it was weird with everything going on in the stock market right now with gme and everything almost like theyre trying to subliminally tell us this is whats going to happen or am i looking too much into it

22,6,2021-02-08 00:01:34,newbies looking at gme greetings fellow tardsautistsapes theres a good chance of this getting downvoted to oblivion but i thought i would try to help new entrants to the gme saga ill try to keep it nice and short after participating in the tardlympics i have noticed a few trends and i think they are likely to repeat on monday the ssr restriction has been lifted after a green day and i believe the shorts will be extremely aggressive lowering the price everyone knows that the updated si gets released tuesday and they are going to try to kill any momentum i dont know if we can even trust the number on tuesday because we all know they have tricks galore up their sleeves and its an old number etc etc but if it comes back high they know everyone will be reinvigorated they want the share price to be as low as possible if that were to happen i have 100 shares and have nothing to gain from this other than hopefully helping others position themselves in a better spot than im in if i were to enter a new position after experiencing the ups and downs i would enter monday afternoon and possibly even ah i have no clue what will actually happen tomorrow but i expect us to open lower and then to slowly fall throughout the day if you feel that we will have takeoff on monday morning go for it but the last thing needed is paper hands joining and selling right away if im wrong and gamestop somehow gets to $200 ill get diamond hands or cant stop wont stop tattooed on myself as punishment no way am i doing that for less than 20k though this is not financial advice just random thoughts by a retard plus any financial advisor would tell you to stay the hell away from gamestop in the short term anyway back to searching for aoc feet pics position and holding

362,62,2021-02-07 21:53:36,check your acount status now shady brokers many brokers have sneakily converted your cash accounts into margin accounts in order to loan your shares to shorts if we all convert back to cash it will force the brokers to call in the shares and the shorts will have to purchase new shares to cover the outstanding this could well cause another squeeze of unimaginable squeezyness if enough people are able to do it before the 9th copied from upandaemonium isnt this the part where you tell me what to do and i do it yesopen a cash account or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled all new gme shares you buy buy from this account and not your old margin account try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account afaik they are not actually obligated to do this they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell but its worth trying we can give good pr to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares and bad reviews for brokerages that block it if you have extra cash and if you dont have extra cash and youre here now may god have mercy on your retard soul you can set up a cash account then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price if you can do both transactions at the exact same price this is identical to 2 where youre doing an inkind transfer between accounts the obvious risk here is that you cant control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high continue spreading the word this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts if just a few people do it it is still marginally effective but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze edit urozhasi says both td ameritrade and fidelity told me that if you remove the margin feature from your current account they cant lend your shares to short sellers edit2 robinhood automatically has margin enabled so we do not want to be using rh at all anymore users report that after transferring from rh to fidelity the fidelity account automatically had margin enabled even though new fidelity accounts default to margindisabled if anyone has experience a transferring rh shares to a nonmargin account or b disabling margin on an account that rh shares have been transferred into edit3 from ubrewlee in degiro you can check it by clicking ladder in top left corner then triangle right to your name then its second position from top you can check your account status there if its not custody i am sorry you pay for the hedges the account at degiro is unchegable you have to make new account and transfer funds credit to upandaemonium for his dd it can be accessed below

18,26,2021-02-06 10:19:42,im tired of seeing people saying that the shorts could not have covered with shit assumptions and subpar mathematics to back it up i did this yesterday so todays numbers are not included i was a chronically high mathcomputer science double major did all of this dd while high used yahoo finance and s3 screenshots and am still holding my 39 shares 250 so i dont know shit and this could be completely wrong a as of 115 there were 6178m shares shorted out of a total 4689 shares available to short b according to s3 estimates shorties didnt start covering until about 128 c total volume of gme since 128 inclusive 5882 5026 3738 7818 427 5975 32709m d weighted average of gme price upon close since 128 the weight is the prices respective volume as a percentage of the total volume since 128 193601798 32501537 22501143 900239 924101305 53501827 $1319987 e assuming shorties played a game of numbers and dcaed $1319987 should be their estimated average cost per share f current estimated short interest is 39 182871m shares so the amount of covered short shares would be 6178 182871 434929 g estimated total cost to cover d e 1319987437929 $57806b 1 we know this estimate is lower than what it really is because in our calculations we assume that only shorts are covering and no new shorts are being opened between 115 and now however in s3s estimates short interest is accumulated after its first decent from the range of 126 131 therefore more shorts must have been covered and new shorts opened 2 we dont know how many shorts covered nor how many new shorts opened but i would guesstimate this isnt greater than a factor of 3 i know shit mathematics right here but we dont know these numbers so this has to be a ballpark estimation h estimated amount spent on gme since 128 d h 131742832709 $430918b i given that $430918b was spent and only $57806b within a factor of 3 so max 173418b was spent on covering shorts it is possible that shorts have covered the amount reported by s3 this doesnt account for option plays nor does it account for short ladder volume i dont know how i would find that 
4,35,2021-02-06 10:19:31,im new non expert totally support beating billionaires but are there other stocks i was in on buying gme this morning but apparently it takes 3 days for money to make it inside my trading app im canadian and apparently they protect me from buying things at low prices for my own good i have never bought stock before and nobody should listen to me but i found a non gme stock and im curious what other people think during covid i think video games weed self love streaming services and billionaires cheating will make up much of the economy since no billionaires will help mei found a way to invest in weed fire 1 they sell marijuana in canada thats legal 2 the stocks cost like 30 cents each and they trade on the toronto stock exchange i have no idea if that means americans can buy it or not at 30c each i can afford to buy like more than 7 stocks unlike gme by the time my app lets me join the party way too late 3 i thought having cheap stocks was a bad sign it probably is i am not an expert but they seem to think this year they will make money that sounds like they should probably do that again not an expert but that sounds important 4 i went to their website and they have a video of a guy sitting on a bench that they must think is awesome but i just laughed check out the io part of their website i think has great emoji potential and i just like the idea of owning a bunch of weed stock for like no money so when the training wheels come off my app i was totally gonna buy weed stocks could i still be stupid if you want to look at it google tsx fire stock

0,10,2021-02-08 06:34:27,dfv a request for a brief history hi been here a while but never posted until the recent hullabaloo in fact i rarely ever looked at the sub but ive had some renewed interest in stonks and the gme story was a really fun one to follow and hell it still is with my renewed interest i watched dfvs youtube videos from 5 months ago and in hindsight man the dude hit the nail on the head tremendous foresight that looking back on it makes him a genius in my book my questions isare how much buzz was there for gme 5 months ago was dfv posting about it or generating interest here how did his word get out generally with such good advice i am wondering how he got people to listen and also i am wondering if people in fact listened are there any other users similar to dfv who are posting about future good value plays i know this was literally a once in a lifetime type of trade with such a value increase but i am wanting to get onboard the next rocketso i need a fucking ticket of course this current rocket is about to go into fucking overdrive so i can wait
0,127,2021-02-08 05:06:42,isnt the smart thing to do now is short gamestop and amc my market understanding is basic but isnt that the next big play bet that the price is going to fall majorly and since the big companies have struck out that would leave the profit all to everyone on the sub and if enough people here short it in reverse to how gme skyrocketed would we not double the profit and have cut out billionaires essentially making a mockery out of fools that put their life savings into lets face it a closed roulette table or is that what influencers have already done and theyre telling this community to keep holding knowing its crashing so the market is easier to predict with a slow crash instead of a hard one thats what id be doing i dont care if everyone else here goes bankrupt so long as ive made a little bit back and youre the exact same if im wrong correct me but everything is now screaming to short
19,19,2021-02-06 12:10:54,why short interest si could be the same on 29 for people who are hanging a lot on the upcoming si report on 29 this is just something you may want to consider i replied to someone with this comment but have found that ive been copypasting it a lot because a lot of you guys seem confused about shorts and short interest so if thats you here goes ill paint with a broad brush here but imagine that a year ago the hedge funds borrowed the equivalent of 50 of gmes float to short when it was at 20shr for illustration purposes lets say thats 100 shares they then sell those shares and collect $2000 confident that when the time comes to return the borrowed shares gme will be 2shr allowing them to buy the 100 shares for $200 return them and pocket the 1800 profit they made originally but disaster strikes a bunch of dumb redditors band together and invest en masse driving the stock price up to 100shr meaning that on due date the hf now needs to shell out $10000 to cover putting them at an 8k loss but it gets worse because these redditors are mad like slinging poop at the walls mad and so the stock looks primed to keep rising like crazy in the near future what do you do well if youre a multimillion dollar hf manager you devise a dastardly yet overall smart plan cut your losses and cover your short position at a loss so you go in and buy like crazy giving you a substantial loss but for every short you close you immediately open a new one to take its place at the current market price which lets say is now 200shr now youre very confident that these redditors will eventually go away and the stock will fall back to its position last year at 20shr and now youre in a position where youre not pocketing the profit from the stock falling from 20shr to 2shr you can pocket the profits from it falling from 200shr to 20shr much better position for you and despite the fact that the short interest is still the same your position is safe because for the squeeze to happen stock would have to be run alllllll the way back up to above 200shr in short money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr for the hedgies as fucking always tldr si may very be the same in the 29 report but their positions will be very different
413,85,2021-02-06 11:59:14,new traders please read in regards to gme market manipulation how to move forward  whats next for gme do i hold do i buy more nobody knows nobody will ever know taking advice from anyone on the internet or in real life especially when finances are involved is idiotic quickly think about every comment youve made pumping gme with rockets and diamond emojis this month ever wonder why you were doing that because you had a particular interest and benefit of the stock price going up thats pumping so you can get the price high enough for you to make money and then leave the others in the dust this is the exact thing pumpers are doing to you it is vital that you stop relying on reddit comments start doing research and put your time to good use since time is in fact money the market is so manipulated its completely unfair and the hedge funds always get away with it yes youre right that is a healthy and intelligent observation the unfortunate truth is this will keep happening there are forces at work so much bigger than any of us and if any of you were a part of the top 01 you would also be clinging on to the power and greed of owning the world or you at least wouldnt relinquish that power to a bunch of college kids on an online forum i love the underdog everybody wanted a david and goliath ending to this but its just not feasible and its time you stop taking your decision to overleverage andor fail to take profit out on the market it is important you begin to study and understand the trends and statistics behind the actual market please the slightest bit of real research could lead to your next play the one that could save you from this gme mess if you learned how to trade options you couldve bought puts and at least balanced out your losses on your gme shares on the way down instead of just eating those bags so what i just sell my gme shares for a huge loss no i would never instruct anybody to sell or buy anything thats the entire point of this post to encourage others to learn how instruct themselves in the stock market considering how many of you are completely new your first trade may have possibly been one of the most volatile in recent history keep your shares thats the beauty of shares is that you own them and over time that value may eventually come back especially if you use other equity to generate enough money to average down your position over time eventually come out on top the only way you will achieve this though is removing gme from your watchlist for a while studying up finding new tickers with real promise instead of short squeeze opportunities and quick spike situations where you will inevitably be fucked i used all my money on this last play i cant do anything now even if that is the case id hope you still have an income or the ability to collect some money over the next few weeks and months while you study the perfect opportunity to learn is when youre forced to watch market action without being able to participate you will be able to accurately see trends and movements without getting fomo or yoloing in at the top learn about options and you will realize that even $100 can be turned into thousands ive done it multiple times this year evidence but the knowledge of trading option contracts and having the ability to make money on green and red days is immeasurable please i beg of you go watch a youtube video or search wsb for a true dd post from a year or two ago in which youll learn a ton of shit that can help you well the market is closed right now so why does this matter its the weekend get the fuck off your ass and away from doggedycoin and make your time make you money study options the greeks most important theta learn about the indexes sp 500 $spy nasdaq $qqq dow jones $djia and the vix an important indicator of volatility in the market the vix $vxx can help you determine the direction of the market before it happens learn it and utilize it im begging you please this will do nothing but help you and keep you away from $rope or worsegiving up on the stonk market i only want the best for you all so i suggest you drop the retard act for two days to figure out how youre going to approach this monday morning
51,63,2021-02-06 11:43:19,lessons to be learned from gme not a post trying to shit on those who held or are holding gme i bought gme i held gme i held it too late and i got out at a loss a pretty significant one even someone like me whose been doing this a few years and is very careful and disciplined can learn a thing or two here first is you should always take out your initial investment if you are in doubt i normally do this with most things if the stock shoots up and doubles really quickly i pull my initial and play with house money if it does quickly maybe i sell the rest and buy low or if it stays consistent then i can always buy back in but this way i dont lose i didnt do this because i bought into the whole short squeeze and the idea that releasing any shares would kill momentum that we all were riding on always take out your initial or minimize loss second is dont take losses too hard ive had and a few downs gme was probably one of my bigger downs but it always gets better take some time away from investments clear your head and get back in there with your new knowledge and learned lessons third is beware of echo chambers and confirmation bias everyone in these gme threads are going to tell you what you want to hear up until recently the right play is always to hear and acknowledge both sides understand what youre doing and go in when you can prove what you know and disprove what others are saying to an extent now ive never been in something this big where the echo chambers were full of so much dd and evaluations and data it made it hard to see things objectively and realize that a $10 to $500 was probably the squeeze did the hedges and everyone else involved play fair hell no but squeezes dont just happen because you collectively buy a lot of stock you cant just squeeze any stock a big player has to back themselves into a really terrible position they cant get out of and have the guts to stick it out while you squeeze them its a very rare thing fourth and finally is you should never put more money in than you are comfortable with losing completely this is a gamble even if you do your dd it can always go wrong for any reason many which you cant even see coming judging by this past week always know your maximum loss and assume thats very possible and likely and make sure youre okay with that i think about it as putting in x and then that money disappearing it never existed for me then if i cut my losses oh look heres x losses amount of money that just showed up i guess i can invest in something else now fifth do you if youre still in gme because you believe in it awesome if youre in it because you really believe in a squeeze great you gotta do what you believe in but make sure its your belief that driving your actions and that its not you latching on to sentiments from others and trying to fool yourself into believing their yours would you still do it if you could no longer discuss it in wsb or on reddit would you still buy or hold would you sell do you look up your own data and learn about what everything means or do you just believe every little thing thats posted in an open online forum again you have to decide stay healthy and stress free folks its just money he says looking at a huge gme loss and crying
83,51,2021-02-06 11:38:25,i hear u like gme so lets talk about elephants in the room i waited a while to post this because tbh i wanted price to fall back to reasonable levels for this dd to make sense so lets talk about couple of things 1 stimulus checks did everyone here forget that there are stimulus checks coming in next couple weeks since yall smooth brains have short memories let me remind you what happened last time with stimulus check people bought stonks so what you think is gonna happen this time around yeah u guessed it stonks most of the smooth brains are gonna throw that money into gme to avg down on it why because we all like the fucking stocklast time we saw stimulus checks of $600 and we all know what happened to stocks like teslaapple etc and those are not even small companies now we have $1400 stimulus checks coming in and that is very likely to blow up stocks like gme dont take my word for it heres forbes article on why stimulus money will blow up stock market 2 paper hands are gone they have been torn apart burned to the ground and most of them are cursing themselves for falling into fomo because they thought they can make quick easy money well surprise motherfucker youre up against the most ruthless people in financial world and this was never gonna be this easy but the good news is that we are left with ones with true diamond hands no matter where the price goes these motherfuckers are not giving up 3 lets not forget why the momentum was broken yeah because of robinfuckinghood and that pissed many people off and many immediately started a process of switching brokers if you remember last friday tdfidelity customer service were busy as fuck i imagine most of it was due to the fact that many robinhood clients wanted to transfer their accounts to them now that those transfers slowly going through and accounts are coming back online to trade many will start buying more if u liked it at $200 u should be loving it at $50 4 i think gmes earnings this quarter will be much better than expected retail traders favouring to shop at gme because we own the fucking business now is one reason and another obvious reason is how much free publicity they got i dont have any data on this so if there are any gme employees that can shed light on how business is doing that would be great position 100 at $72 and will be adding as price moves lower this isnt financial advice i just like the stock and wanted to share my thoughts

90,62,2021-02-06 11:23:34,gme fatigue disclaimer im not a hedgefund manager a big bad banker or part of melvin capital trying to convince you to sell literally any post on the top page is just a pumpup of $gme $amc for the past 2 weeks is this not getting old how many memes posts of diamond hand$ im not selling until $10000 can we really enjoy its mainly posts done for quick karma boosts and for desperate attempts to salvage a potentially shitty position because you entered at $400 when you knew jack shit about stocks and now youre experiencing your first loss and your peasized brain thinks that if enough people see my post on here about gme my stonk will moon bring back some variety and some quality memes the warren buffet on cnbc interview about his willy type quality the way this shit is right now it should be called rgmecirclejerk but this is a historic moment dude things like this have been happening ever hear of a stock called tesla in all seriousness love this sub but im hoping we move away from this damn echo chamber pretty soon just some thoughts ill take my downvotes now
0,25,2021-02-06 11:21:53,i was verbally slammed and eviscerated by a melbot today  it took me a long time to recover from the absolute knee to the stomach karate chop to the neck nature of what has transpired this friday several minutes ago i made an innocent comment about the squeeze is not over and hedge funds are manipulating the market this is an inarguable statement as the s in hedge funds stands for short laddering as retaliation a hedge shill launched an attack against me unungie called me a bagholder ive been huddled up in front of my screen without it powered on just letting myself get lost in the black abyss never in my life did i think the vicious rumor that i am a bagholder would be broadcast to so many redditors ive already received dozens of messages from people informing me that i am no longer welcome on the gme daily discussion thread i was at a job interview this afternoon and it was going great they pulled the interviewer out of the room to talk however and when he returned he only said over and over the squeeze is over i wound up sobbing and shouting i dont know i dont know and they laughed me out of the building im currently with my mom at the moment she says itll all be okay and the misunderstanding will clear up soon im not so sure im going to be headed out for the weekend for vacation now much needed compared to before so i wont be able to really do much more than bring this heinous crime to light i vow there shall be repercussions if this foul mistake is not cleared up big repercussions
11,14,2021-02-06 11:17:57,the case for holding gme and the case against it this entire thing has been crazy and this sub is different than it used to be and it will probably never come back anyways the entire reason to hold gme is the short squeeze and this revolves around 2 things 1 the amount of shares short sold 2 the amount of shares being held by retail investors and so are not on the market being traded we have no idea the true values for either of these things for 1 we have estimates that vary wildly and everyone will follow their own biases on what they decide and for 2 we will never know but there is good reason to believe as of today february 5th its a lesser portion than it was last wednesdayfriday so people holding gme are gambling on these 2 unknown values being in a good proportion to drive the price up the only real reason i can see that would say the amount of shares shorted is still very high is this whywhen do investors short a stock when they think it is going down we all know that by now so when these hedge funds shorted at $5 or $10 oh yea they were making a risky ass move and paid for it but what stopped them from covering these and shorting again at $200 or $300 or $400 they probably did at least to some degree and theyre well in the money with these shorts and they also could have closed these shorts as the stock price fell and continued to go down over and over again so right now short interest or the amount of shares shorted might not really matter it may be really high but you dont know at what price they shorted and it could be very high i think this is much more likely than them keeping their original shorts they had before all this something to think about sorry to burst the ehco chamber im guilty in this too im just hoping to have a conversation about this and to maybe save a retard who yolod their life savings into this so really as far as holding goes you are betting on things you dont know currently being what you thought they were a week ago you may be right
6,27,2021-02-08 09:47:23,what is to stop hedge funds from illegally covering their gme shorts and simply paying a negligible fine of a few million as opposed to hundreds of billions of dollars ok so we all know that hedge funds are bullshit and buddybuddy with one another as well as politicians even if they occasionally war with each other as mark cuban said it seems like robinhood citadel melvin and everyone else who stood to lose hundreds of billions combined came together and put a stop to the gme short squeeze it seems like whenever these hedge funds commit fraud they already know beforehand and calculate the penalties into their accounting for the year a few million even tens of millions is chump change for these people they gain or lose that amount within seconds on the market these guys stood to lose hundreds of billions if the gme squeeze was successful but it seems like they have so many tricks and underhanded ways to deal with the squeeze including some probably illegal stuff that they will just pay a fine for what gives
18,6,2021-02-08 09:44:49,a little bit of dd re elons takedown of vlad and the ongoing role of citadel if you havent listened to elon musks interrogation i mean interview of vlad the rh ceo then you are missing out heres the entire interview both audio and text heres some spicy bits about what happened on day robinhood sold out its customers jan 28 thursday vlad tenev and so thursday morning so im sleeping but at three thirty am pacific our operations team receives a file from the nscc which is the national securities clearing corporation so basically as a broker as a clearing broker and this is where robinhood securities comes in we have to put up money to the nscc based on some factors including things like the volatility of the trading activity concentration into certain securities and this is this is the equities business so its based on stock trading and not options trading or anything elseso they gave us a file with the deposit and the the request was around three billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is elon musk so why is this kind of like this seems like like it sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital what formula that they use to calculate that vlad tenev well yeah and just to give context robinhood up until that point has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capitalup until now so its a big number like three billion dollars this is a large number so basically the and you know the details are we dont have the full details its a little bit of an opaque formula but theres a component called the var of it which is value at risk and thats based on kind of some fairly quantitative things although its not its not fully transparent so there are ways to reverse engineer it but its not kind of publicly sharedand then theres a special component which is discretionary so thats that kind of acts as a multiplier and basically elon musk discretionary discretionary meaning like its just their opinion vlad tenev yeah its its a little bit i mean im sure theres theres definitely more more than just their opinion but basically elon musk i mean i guess what theyve gone through everyone wants to know whatever it was like did something maybe shady go down here like it just seems weird that you get a sudden ten billion dollar demand you know three billion or even more sorry how much vlad tenev yeah it was three billion elon musk up two to three billion around you know just suddenly out of nowhere and what does vlad tenev i wouldnt i wouldnt i wouldnt impute shadiness to it or anything like that and actually you know the nscc was reasonable subsequent to this and theyve been theyve been they worked with us to actually lower it so it was unprecedented activity you know we dont i dont have the full context about you know what was what was going on in whats going on in the in that is key to make these calculationsbut yeah essentially elon musk if anyone holding you hostage right now what vlad calls the nscc was reasonable subsequent to this was the $3b deposit was lowered to $700m by the nscc after rh suspended buy trading on gme among other things that vlad doesnt say but must know is this citadel has huge influence on the dtccnscc a nongovernmental industry consortium which put the demand as was well evidenced by this redditors post bottom line rhs biggest of all customer citadel was able to play the telephone game to get the message loud and clear to robinhood enjoy
54,26,2021-02-08 08:22:02,an explanation of gmes last few weeks through an analogy  imagine youre playing a game of chess in a tournament your opponent has been in the world of chess a lot longer than you and has a suspicious history of winning however in this particular game he overextended himself in an attempt to make a quick buck defeat you quickly you noticed what your opponent was doing and while sticking the rules of chess you took advantage of his greed and foolishness you have now cornered your opponent all he has remaining are a handful of pawns and his king you still have the majority of your pieces your winning of the match is all but inevitable its your opponents turn now and after he moves one of his pawns he not so subtly knocks one of your bishops onto the ground he tries to be sneaky about this but if you were looking at him it was pretty apparent what he did it doesnt matter even though youre down another piece your opponent is still stuck in his predicament with no way out you move your knight to a position where it will be mate in 3 its your opponents turn again he moves another pawn and then knocks your robinhood knight off the table again as long as you were paying attention it was pretty obvious what happened however the sec referee of this match wasnt paying any attention to your opponent in fact the ref never seems to be paying attention to your opponent he doesnt think he has to the ref is sure your opponent is just an allaround good dude who pulled himself up by his bootstraps and would never cheat the ref if anyone would know that since the ref and your opponent actually go waaaay back i mean he was best man at his wedding and their daughters play lacrosse together no action is taken and the pattern continues and as each day turn passes your pieces continue to be illegally removed from the board your position pun intended is beginning to look dire taking a glance at the board though this makes no sense it is nearly impossible for the board to have gotten to this state through a series of legal moves going by the rules of chess this game should have been done or close to it by now with you as the undisputed winner even though you have chipped away at your opponents remaining pawns you are now at a fraction of the number of pieces that you started with and most of those missing are mysteriously on the ground your opponent looks at you and asks if you want to just sell your stocks surrender the game early at this rate he says youre bound to lose even more pieces before the game is over you shake your head there is still hope although your pieces have been decimated through means that the ref has turned a blind eye to your opponents king still has not left his corner he is still stuck it is at this moment that hordes of hedge fund shills and fake redditors completely random bystanders come over to spectate your game they begin heckling you they are calling you a bagholder stupid for daring to think you could beat an opponent with such experience they are vehemently urging you to quit and their urges are definitely coming from an unbiased place since they are definitely not simps friends of your opponent during all of this chaos somehow more of your pieces were removed from the board even though the markets closed it wasnt your opponents turn you look at the current state of the board and contrast it to how it was shortly after your opponent got greedy sure its a disaster but you can still win it may be much tougher now but the fundamentals are still good the way the game is going it looks like it may end up carrying on for a long time but you know one thing you wont quit whether it be a stalemate or the win you deserve you wont give up the game to a cheater fuck cheaters and fuck everyone who hates on gme being a movement if youre here as an investor who is not about this being a movement the fundamentals are still good if youre here as a compulsive gambling addict who is not about this being a movement the fundamentals are still good hold the line x200b feel free to take this and copypaste it anywhere with the current state of wsb im not surprised if this gets deleted quickly disclaimer this is not financial advice yada yada yada i dont even know how to play chess because im a retard

2568,1071,2021-02-06 13:43:55,you people need to understand that you are not waging a war on hedge funds this isnt some ideological battleground this is the stock market there are hedge funds taking long positions there are hedge funds going short and hedging their bets with long positions youre not sticking it to the man holding gme trade based on what makes you money not ideology who gives a fuck we dont celebrate losses here to prove a point we celebrate the stupid risky plays that the person took regardless of the fact it blew up in their face if you think youre going to profit off holding hold stop letting people hype you up and manipulate you by framing this as some act of defiance against a corrupt system youre being played

246,81,2021-02-09 05:27:20,short information coming out on the 9th for gme i just wanted to bring attention to those who do not know the short interest information is coming out on the 9th in regards to gme hedge short positions now there have been a lot of posts talking about why the short interest is still going to be substantial i believe on jan 15th the percentage was something above 80 shorted shares of the outstanding shares since then the media and hedges have been doing everything they can to drive the price down it is blatantly obvious for the last few days gme has seemed to hit a wall at around that $5060 range which means they are struggling to drive it down further even with the manipulation i think the second part of the squeeze is imminent this is not financial advise if you dont have money you are willing to lose dont invest your finance decisions are entirely your own responsibility let me know what you think is going to happen on tues
1789,568,2021-02-08 20:59:40,dd why gamestop gme is worth $1000 without a squeeze a little background first gamestop was heavily shorted last year as hedge funds though it was a dying company however in september ryan cohen who is the largest individual hold of apple stock and founder of hugely profitable digital per food company chewy started buy huge chunks of gme stock and indicating he was going to turn the company from brick and mortar retailer to a profitable online gaming juggernaut also michael burry of the big short fame sent a letter to the gme board once wsb got hold of this we saw the huge inflows of retail traders which pushed the price to $480 before buying was restricted culling the potential short squeeze now gamestops price to sales ratio ps ration is currently less than 1 market cap $44bn annual revenue $7bn this seems fine for a dying brick and mortar but if the company becomes profitable likely in next earning report in march and starts to transform into a tech digital platform for gaming likely as e aws exec hired as cto its ps ratio will start rising to match other tech companies square sq for example has a ps ratio of 14 if gme had a similar ps ratio after the above happens the share price would be well above $1000 per share also remember the market is forward looking so if it seems signs of profitability and transformation then it will head to that valuation well before the process is complete i am not a financial advisor and this is not advice this is my personal opinion only edit thanks for all the awards folks ignore the bots and shills with this is retarded comments with no counter arguments why would they make comments like this they must be scared edit 2 this is an update for those who have a hard time understanding my post ill dumb it down a bit for you guys with eh limited iqs tech companies are valued at higher multiples than brick and mortar stores the new gamestop board is looking to transform it into a tech business see tesla vs legacy auto and the difference in multiples there
31597,2446,2021-02-08 18:02:11,reminder of what actually happened with gme all you people saying things like the squeeze happened you missed it dont gamble on stocks the bagholders were the greedy ones people with no experience trading shouldnt have bought gme gme was a stupid play from the beginning i was wrong to buy gme i should have sold gme are all talking complete fucking bullshit and are twisting the truth and recollection of what actually happened in reality for actual fact i dont know if they are bots people who missed out or bitter bag holders but they are just fucking dead wrong about what the gme play was attempting and came within a few hours of accomplishing gme went from $40 to a peak of $483 within a week the biggest shorter got bailed out for $275bn because of how bad their position was wsb was getting national fucking coverage this sub went from 2 million to 8 million subscribers there were 60 million shares shorted going into thursday and at its all time high would have cost a staggering 29bn dollars to buy back less whatever they were shorted at and that is not even counting the price going up by doing so so no the squeeze didnt fucking happen no you werent wrong for buying in at 200 or 300 or even 400 the play worked and it got within hours of paying out i know this because the brokers got margin called by the clearing houses for fuck sake now rh and other brokers might say it was liquidity issues but i can tell you for a fact that all those shorters got their shares from somewhere and if you think a few million people buying shares with cash deposits in any way compares to the almost certain losses that the brokers were facing due to likely defaults by shorters was the reason they turned off buying you are dead fucking wrong the brokers got margin called any way you look at it and they should have margin called the shorters but they didnt they pussied out and did something criminal they affected one side of a trade and not the other that is an unprecedented manipulation if ever i have seen one but i aint suprised by it and neither should anyone else and that is not the point of this post anyway stop saying it didnt work it was never going to work we got greedy we got stupid and all the other hind sight self delusions to make yourself feel better the play worked because it went by the rules these people had set and you cant blame yourself or anyone else or redicule people for getting involved when those rules get changed at the last second the gme play was solid and made history never forget that you fucking pussies edit i sold at 42069 the other week and put it all back in on friday just gone make of that whatever you want edit2 yeah i took some profit i never said i was the hero of this story edit3 cant keep up with comments either you believe brokers restricted buying because of increased collateral requirements due to users buying in cash or you believe that maybe the tens of billions of increased buyback costs on shares they had lent out where somehow setting off the clearing houses tolerance alarms your choice and i have not and will not advise anyone to do anything regarding the future of gme make your own fuckin mind up thank you for all the pretty icons
7,43,2021-02-06 16:21:49,can someone explain to me a few things about amc stock for what we know it is not as shorted as gme correct if i remember correctly its only at 7080 shorted vs gme closer to 120 2 weeks ago is there any way the could use the remaining to fill their shorts over time by trading between each other gme 45 $170 all are in my will free ps5 or xbox whatevers for all of us
0,10,2021-02-06 16:01:44,retards holding multiple hundred shares of $gme i dont know how autistic you guys have to be to know this game is up because you guys attracted too much pussies in game and those pussies sold at stop loss so go ahead and sell call options for the shares youre holding if gme falls you still get something from selling the options if it reaches the strike price you still get to sell at strike price literally win win situation

332,102,2021-02-06 15:33:41,gme and future of wsb  fellow retards i have a couple points id like to discuss i owned gme and sold it most of them when robinhood screwed us for good i made tendies which is what mattered and why i have been in the sub im not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but i agree that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion ive been following the sub around a year i was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didnt make me a lot of tendies i got hooked in during marchapril when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on spy and calls on tesla i was amazed by beautiful retardness wsb did something truly amazing gme was the trade of this quarter century a dude in basement with dds and bunch of retards did something crazy thousands of retards made thousands of dollars it has changed lifes for good for many people however the sub has been fallen victim to its success let me be clear the gme was to make tendies taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged its what it is unless you have a trillion dollar you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards when gme took off and went viral truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a movement tvs newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and elon musk and mark cuban supported thispositions or bantalk is cheap i read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds now gme is the only thing we have lost tesla gangpalantir gangpalenton gangtheta gang who had provided real dd and were the people who came up with gme along with many other trades those people made wsb a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to 42069 now we cannot hear them due to noise now the sub is filled with people who just yell hold buy more who holds gme will go to moon i hope it does and people who got fucked recover but this reduces the sub into a single trade where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money guess who benefits from this current state gme diamond hands with $1000 or wall st who is playing carrot on a stick a hedge fund made $700m on gme citadel who has shady relationships with robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume a lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions and we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of who holds gme$5000 is not a meme id love hearing dds like dfvs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards they just yell some slogans and getting emotional sharing the old finra report wont help us i wholeheartedly hope that gme holders are right it goes to $5000 and makes millions id be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade or bang we actually give up millions of tendies on other trades we dont get new info we dont get new dds please stop spamming and provide actual dd so it can actually bring people back on gme if you are right this would help you too we need to find our next gmes thats how you make tendies we need retards who got stuff right like messiah dfv so we can win everytime we make a good trade you actually fight off the rigged system tldr gme narrows down us to a single trade we need to restore our dna and get ddsreduce noise and hear new things that can make us tendies otherwise gme can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make tendies thank you for reading and now fuck off
13,119,2021-02-06 14:44:30,what if we are underestimating the size of the gme powder keg purely speculation but given how absolutely excessive the hedge funds dtcc and brokers have tried to keep gme from squeezing im wondering if weve completely underestimated the damage a real gme squeeze might do do we actually know what the real otc short interest is at and can we trust the reported number what if its 10x or 100x higher wed have no idea if the short squeeze actually happened which is a theoretical infinite squeeze drive the gme price so some ridiculous million dollar mark even if briefly melvin will go bankrupt sure but theyre a pretty small fish it seems excessive to do all this manipulation to save a fledging hedge fund unless the brokers dtcc maybe even the entire market is under threat causing the coordinates attacks were seeing in an effort to diffuse this we also havent heard a peep from anything from inside these organizations or hedges it feels like a strict gag order is in effect and the one insider post if you believe it seems to paint a picture of an absolute panic inside the financial system which again seems excessive if only a few smaller hedges like melvin are being taken down
21,22,2021-02-06 14:30:14,gme fatigue look i like gme just as much as the next guy etc im still holding and buying dips but the only thing i see is gme posts is this just me or do multiple people feel the same way
5,35,2021-02-06 14:09:13,numbers dont lie if you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole gme thing was probably engineered by hedge funds citadel sac to suck in retail retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell gme for $300 citadel has access to robinhoods order flow their whole business model is to front run you so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar after the squeeze melvin received fresh capital they never got squeezed wsb lost money this was probably a set up by sac citadel to squeeze retail with gme while everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to wall street someone else was unloading worthless gme shares for $300 then they continued from $300 down to $50 while wsb was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting in the end you guys became famous and lost money while hedge funds made money but were humiliated edit till this morning accounts with less than 1500 couldnt comment now they can suddenly comment again since i posted this and another post about extreme silver positioning this subreddit is captured by hedge funds the sec needs to investigate admins and all reddit logs about the activity here these guys engineered a pnd gme and hid it in plain sight by making it look like retail short squeezed a hedge fund sec are you watching edit 2 grammar
11,6,2021-02-06 16:34:27,hope to hold for now and forever since many a ape will lose bananas and their own sanity throughout the weekend i find it useful for any that are giving into negativity by the hands that give handjobs with the quality grip of paper to realise gme is not just a mere speculative bubble anymore but a plausible and prosperous business model with longevity in mind here is an extract from a research paper of what to think about while you hold with those diamond hands of yours if you must get further approval from your wifes boyfriend then do so but make your own choices although the yearslong short thesis implies a terminal value of zero bankruptcy we see this outcome as virtually impossible given the current state of gamestops financials incoming console revenue and proven ecommerce results trajectory in fact our analysis clearly shows 3 distinct paths to profitability a bear case $3200 tracking the existing gamestop reboot initiative with successful footprint rationalization to 2000 stores in north america by 2023 steady ecommerce contribution and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates a base case $8000 that is similar but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors and some participation in other digitalfirst businesses a bull case $16900 based on a full transition by 2025 to the ecommerce first cultural gaming hub hinted at by ryan cohen with a significant increase in revenue attributed to ecommerce new vendor partnerships meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming and growth acceleration in the overall tam for gaming source i need to confess i sold as the doubt kicked in and the paper hands got to me so that makes me a paper hand chimp now forgive me my hands may have became paper however i promise i will turn these disgusting socalled hands back into beautiful diamonds by holding till they touch the dark side of the moon to repent for my sin mandatory emojis i do need to say i have lost more money in life than ive made with very poor life choices resulting in further poor outcomes as such i am not and never will be qualified to be a financial advisor and everything i wrote is fictional at best
0,34,2021-02-06 16:27:28,i dont give a shit about your wholesome story regarding your gains its the most cringe shit ever post it in rall or rwholesome cuz thats where it belongs ive literally seen motherfuckers post i paid off my chemo with my gme gains or i finally have enough to buy my first car because of gme and thanks to gme i can finally pay for my sisters wedding nobody fucking cares i literally guarantee you maybe 1 of pre 2020 wsb users care this is not a place for you to share you heart warming story about how your life turned around people here make $200k all the time and you know what they do post a screenshot of their account and thats it cuz thats all its about literally take your karma farming bullshit elsewhere you npcs 
65,88,2021-02-06 17:26:43,wsb has been taken hostage by new mods allowing bots and fake accounts overrun the sub with gme hate gme the only reason the narrative would change so drastically is because of this watch my post get bombarded with extremely hateful disrespectful fear mongering comments the mods have been compromised nobody on this sub can be trusted anymore and all of you should know that now stay stronk gme stonk
0,45,2021-02-06 17:23:41,why are posts being removed all of a sudden i see posts especially those about gme being removed which wasnt the case until this couple of dayswhy
143,129,2021-02-06 16:49:23,stop with the ape crap its in your best interest to stop acting like a bunch of dumb sheep who bought gme simply because they were following wsb dfv or the crazy fomo price action that stupid ape narrative will only be used to protect you with more trading restrictions for the lower classes think of the part time day trading rules which make it harder to make money but worse if youre new here apes together strong was never a thing until the last couple weeks it showed up with all the new people bots before then we called people retards not as a sign of strength in numbers but to make fun of people that think they understand the market and get burned i mean yeah its a joke about us being dumb but along with loss porn its a reminder to fucking be careful anything could happen use risk management this is a fucking casino you could be right about some stupid stock going up 5 tomorrow or the whole god damned market could crash and youll just be another loser down 20 regardless of your amazing dd we all know the risks so dont whine about losing all your money dont ask for handouts on this sub because you risked more than you could lose more than anything stop acting like ignorance makes you strong it never did its your money you made grown up decisions own your losses dont let legislation take more freedoms away from us within the free market to protect us the poor dumb apes wsb is being scapegoated for this fiasco even though many of us had good reasons to invest in gme the thing that wasnt accounted for by most people was the sudden restriction on buying for multiple days until all momentum died the ability for brokers to abruptly make that decision needs to be challenged so pull yourself together and do some research about the way brokers created an artificial selling pressure to push the price down then maybe contact your state representatives with something more coherent than diamond hands and ape noises edit typos because its 1am im tired and retarded
0,7,2021-02-10 01:11:37,no more gme threadsplease dearest tards while you have your breakfast of glue covered crayons id like you to hear my suggestion my girlfriends husband is in this sub and all hes been doing this past weeks is reading the gme threads and claiming to know exactly what the price of gme ought to be hes never visited yahoo finance and doesnt even know what an investor relations section is he listens to robinhood snacks podcast which is where he gets all his stock advice from the gme thread is all he is counting on and its giving him an unrealistic expectation that this play is a sure thing rather than realizing its one of the riskiest bets currently available on the market whats even more retarded him and his boys club can not stop publicly announcing every single thought thats on their mind which means every single player on wall street can see exactly how to manipulate these apes the gme thread made sense last week when it got filled 4 times with 100k comments the limit but today its an invitation to advertise youre retardedness and it does more harm than good if newbies need a gme thread to ask questions on well guess what every fucking question has already been answered if you just use the fucking search bars this subreddit is very well organized and we dont need an extra retarded thread tldr no more gme thread its an invitation to coordinate and lets hf see exactly what you are thinking

676,269,2021-02-07 01:46:56,we are not your friends we are not your friends people who tell you to buy or sell are not doing it because they want you to make money they are doing it because they want to make money off you i shorted gme so if i tell people to sell it is because i want to make money i do not care about whether or not you make millions or lose everything but ask yourself why people are telling you to buy they dont know you and they do not care if you make or lose money they are telling you to buy because they want to make money off you if you want to buy or sell gme that is fine but if you buy or sell gme because someone on reddit told you to you are a fool and you are allowing people to make money off you tldr think for yourself because if you let people think for you they will take advantage of you
0,19,2021-02-07 01:45:28,to all the ogs who hate the way this subreddit has become your subreddit is dead and you wont make these monkey retards leave no matter what so you might as well not bother trying the same way gme has lost all its value so has your dear community and i hate to break it to ya but this sub is infected it is indeed unfair how life treats us but it is what it is and you have no more power than the gme monkey squad so you should probably look into creating a new sub instead of trying to remove all these people that you have 0 power over

186,53,2021-02-07 01:18:39,you people need to understand that we like the stock its that simple seeing some posts putting wsb down recently and how we are not waging war on hedge funds or whatever the fact is we like gme stock many people like gme stock and many people were hurt in 2008 by the fat cats so who cares if some hedge funds made or lost money maybe some are still bleeding money due to shorting millions of shares also if you came here for investing advice then youre an ape who is probably in the right place

82,27,2021-02-06 21:41:30,if youre not happy with robinhood get out and go to another brokerage this is what hurts them the most at the end of the day remember that to robinhood the users are the products not clients they will be losing their product if youre out of gme you can probably be stuck to a position for a week if youre still in gme you are diamond handing so you should be fine with not touching your portfolio for a week
6729,1107,2021-02-06 21:23:36,psa to newer members of wsb i want to clarify a few things to some newer members you have taken a few jokes we make seriously and it will cause you to lose money first fomo is an extremely bad reason to buy a stock or options if you have to every ask is it too late it is too late dont ever buy a stock after it has rocketed up to ath this was a very very standard but of advice until gme made its crazy run now it seems like the norm its not it never was and it never will be gme is a once in a lifetime run you will very likely never see another one second diamond hands pretty much the same story diamond hands was seen as a very very stupid thing to do anytime you nailed even a 2 bagger we would always always tell you to sell it all or at the very least sell half to secure some profit and hold the other half as a gamble another note on diamond hands if you are not familiar with organized pump and dump groups please read up on them they create runs on a stock then convince other people to buy it while they sell off securing profits the 3 biggest ways to spot a pump and dump is 1 fomo and 2 they tell you have diamond hands prior to diamond hands they would say it might dip but thats expected dont sell it will go up lastly they will always sell it as a sure thing no stock is ever a sure thing new people that witnessed gme are making these pump and dumps extremely easy to pull off my last bit of advice bag holding isnt a sound strategy holding a stock because you are down on it and only because you are down on it is stupid plain and simple only ever hold on to a stock if you really think its going to go up with good reason you can sell take what money is left and buy something else that will return a better profit when you lose ask yourself if i didnt own this stock right now would i buy it at its current price having seen it drop if the answer is yes then hold it if the answer is i would cum in my pants for a chance to buy in at this price having no losses then double the fuck down and buy more i have been on wsb for almost 10 years i learned to trade here i dont have a job and trade full time for my income there are some very very smart people here it is up to you to find those people and learn from them while ignoring or laughing at the retards losing money for the memes lastly inverse wsb is a very legit strategy think about that doing the exact opposite of the front page of wsb has good returns fscomeau ill miss you you glorious bastard edit someone rightfully pointed out that the inverse wsb strategy has gotten its ass royally handed to it in the last 8 months so maybe im that old guy that is struggling to keep up with change
0,16,2021-02-06 20:40:27,shouldnt melvin go under by now i have a lot of questions about the gme short on the hedge fund side im low key hoping that a former hedge fund personinsidertrading veteran will share some insight but hey ill take any answer thats backed up by research 1 how does a hedge fund stay alive after sustaining billions in losses ive heard rumors of them selling their long positions to cover their shorts having time to pay for the shares they shorted and receiving a loan from citadel im assuming theyve played both sides of the trade and took out new short positions based on recent prices 2 if they are going under then how long could it take are there historical examples we can point to ie late 90s2008 3 there was a rumor that a ny pension fund is affiliated with melvin is this true if so what the hell would happen if an entire hedge fund gambles a pension fund away hoping theyre smart enough to diversify their clients assets any historical examples we can point to 4 i heard a rumor yes yet another rumor that multiple hedge funds went undersustained huge losses does anyone have specific insight into this 5 do we know generally or specifically what securitiesassets that melvin and other related hedge funds haveare invested in i know we dont have much transparency in terms of investments in the us but may be theres a well hidden publicly facing investor report that their clients receive 6 if we dont know the assets theyre invested in how did we manage to find out that they were behind the gme short 7 do we know of a country with disclosure laws that require individualshedge funds to disclose their positions
12,139,2021-02-06 20:18:52,im getting my inheritance from my trust tomorrow should i buy gme stock with it i finally get my inheritance from my trust tomorrow i want to show my parents i can invest well and make money with money i am thinking of going all in on gme is this a good idea
2912,325,2021-02-10 11:59:45,instead of thinking like gme bag holders start thinking like gme owners many of us here are gme owners now whether we currently like it or not but as owners you have the potential to vote on company decisions the venn diagram of gme holders and gamers in this subreddit is probably pretty close to being one circle if we pooled all of our ideas for the company into threads collectively voted the least retarded ones to the top and proposed them to management we could potentially grow the intrinsic value of gamestop ourselves having a subreddit rebuild a company is not unheard of given what the subs already done in the past what if we could be the rocket fuel
13,14,2021-02-07 03:57:23,more focus on vlad tenez testifying on feb18 if we got more eyes on vlad testifying on feb 18 wouldnt it help our gme movement i dont know how but more media attention and focus would get more people to see that robinhood screw the people on gme what are your thoughts on that politico robinhood ceo expected to testify before maxine waters panel on gamestop 
330,110,2021-02-07 03:34:05,pay no attention to the astroturfing campaign happening at the moment you like me probably have noticed the large influx of bots and shills that have come into the sub and started posting anti diamond hand memes about the hedges winning and us holders as idiots pay them no mind its a coordinated campaign to get you the retail investor to sell why well the reality is that the stock is still heavily shorted also this is a real test of corrupt capital gme on this sub even a week ago was a populist disorganized movement against organized corrupt capital or thats how the overwhelming majority of comments saw it with no deadline on the time in which they have to cover their shorts and pay back loans in the case of melvin 20 on a 23 billion loan its a game of chicken for every day they dont cover they stand to lose a lot of money and they are bleeding they are using mimetic warfare to get you to lose confidence this is called psychological informational warfare if youre holding i say do you dd and maybe look at the underlying reasons the short position as to why the stock is a good hold a the end of the day fuck these botsshills and fuck the sec i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice bought in 35 shares at 290 and still holding diamond hand guys notice how the subs sentiment magically changed how these inorganic or awkward feeling users magically came in and started making fun of us where there is smoke there is fire and when you are over target you will take flak diamond hands only guys
12,76,2021-02-07 03:18:04,to everyone that been holding gme this past week an may still be holding i have a question have you all looked at other charts this week companies that have been mention on this sub have been absolutely killing it stocks like spce crsr apha dkng even bb have all ended the trading week with some pretty good gains yet this past week ive seen nothing but increasing positions hold or nothing and of course non stop conspiracies followed by loss porn thats not even fun to watch the real concerning thing is that ive seen a lot of posts claiming to be first time investors dumping their small life savings into gme my question is why is it just fomo like you still believe the squeeze hasnt happened yet is it denial why not just except your losses and put whatever money you have left in the countless other winning bets
22,35,2021-02-07 03:05:59,everyone for $1000 and why we should be hoping for 31 x$100 instead think about this bulls and bears squabbling back and forth hfs dealing with massive potential losses willing to potentially taking legally questionable actions retail investors losing big gains and getting tin foil hat sick gmes market cap roller coaster making company moves difficult to plan if gme split shares 31 it could solve a lot of the problems for all sides 1 retail investors lets say you bought in at $300 and now were down to $60 if a split occurred your share would turn to three valued at $20 demand surges from hfs to help cover their shorts as well as new retail investors sending the stock back to $100 your one share losing $240 is now 3 shares worth your initial investment also allows people to average down for those average share under $300 currently gains 2 hfs if hfs are short they can grab a good chunk of shares to cover 13 of their short position at a discount the hfs shorting at $400 currently would only need new shares to stay under $133 to cover stabilizes the beasts by their direct surge in buying the lower value shares to bring value up positively impacting retail investors nothing will change some folks sentiment about hfs but it would be at least a more legal way for them to play their games while not borking the retail investor like they have been 3 gme the roller coaster stock pricesmarket cap make planning for investmentspivots by the new leadership difficult to calculate by splitting and seeing a surge to find a common ground in this scenario gmes market cap would be $21b a lot for a failing game store hf thesis for shorting and to pivot for massive company evolution bull retail investorsi like the stock crowd ie i have 100 shares if it memed out and got to $1000 each whos to say the brokerages could universally looking at you rh pay out for people who dip out at $1000 my 100 shares i bought close to the top $300 for $30k would then become 300 shares at $100 bringing me back even on investment but now in possession of a valuable asset i could choose to sell gme has a stockpile of cash from these adjustments to make major moves in the market if i hold my now recovered $30k gme could go up based on new initiatives especially after all this free publicity if i dont really love the stock i can get out and get my money back for those who averaged below $300 a share or hold shares from the before times you end up with some pretty significant and stable gains with 3x as many shares in a company poised for a massive pivot not a pessimist all the way but if i could triple my stake in a company i believe in and see my initial investment get back to close to even watching gme have the capital to make some gigantic leaps at the expense of the hfs fixing their mess by jacking up the new diluted share price i wouldnt exactly be mad plus new investorspeople finally able to average down would see gains that looks to me like 3 parties current holders gme and new retail investors winning at the expense of hfs fixing their garbage hands while jacking the price for shareholders
666,177,2021-02-07 03:02:29,what happened last week was not a selloff melvin capital has been and is going to continue throw a lot of tricks at us that will make it look like the stock is dropping even more this week dont fall for it do not sell if you see any of these things happen 1 gme drops by 30 or more after hours 2 sec filings show that shorts have all exited their positions 3 gme drops below $1 a share 4 the gamestop locations near you start closing 5 gme files for bankruptcy 6 gme is delisted from the stock exchange 7 your bank forecloses on your home for late payment 8 your children have children of their own who grow up and become investment bankers and tell you that you should stop telling people youre diamond handing a company that went out of business 30 years ago these are classic hedgefund tricks
58,26,2021-02-07 02:45:48,stay vigilant and skeptical there are so many imposters among us and if youre new it might not be as obvious this is one more post to remind you to remain skeptical and analyze the posts youre reading and do your own dd im not a super og here but ive been around for over a year and its insane how obvious the trickery is how many super manipulative posts and comments im seeing that oppose this subs mantra right now so much sudden gain porn amount gme sellers posts trash talking holders saying holding is a bad strategy when youre down and posts trying to justify selling right now in any way possible they are designed to sound logical or even be filled with a few logical points with the part about how you should sell carefully transplanted in bullshit obviously listen retard you dont typically buy shares to try to make a fat short term gain you trade options so anyone convincing you that its a normal good idea to buy and sell shares on highs and lows in a small time frame is a dumbass if you buy shares you typically hold for longer than a fucking week and go for a ride for some real growth or you learn your hypothesis was wrong or was changed by an event and you pivot this is normal yes there is a potential squeeze which is more reason to keep your fucking pants on yes the hypothesis has remained 100 unchanged though certain news sources will try to have you believe otherwise missing a high isnt the end of the world be patient and it will inevitably surpass that price in some amount of time if the company isnt doomed its not and the economy isnt tanking its not in this case probably pretty god damn soon at least if you dont listen to me listen to fucking cuban his words were a blessing for this sub powerful messages to keep us united through this shit storm coming from someone that has a lifetime of experience remember why you bought gme has it changed then continue pursuing the value play you started until it does if you bet more than you can afford to say goodbye to for monthsyears you probably fell prey to fomo and are an amateur thats not ideal so dont ruin your life over this shit be realistic if you can afford to its common fucking sense to hold right now hey now you get to learn to weather a storm like any seasoned trader so sit down buckle up and shut the fuck up this is not financial advice i literally just got done snorting glue gme to andromeda and past 
14,36,2021-02-07 02:45:22,hard truth its entirely mathematically possible for shorts to cover last week if a share can be shorted multiple times it can be bought and covered multiple times how did 140 short ratio happened a has one gme share a loans the share to b b sold it short to c c loans it to d d sold it short to e one share shorted twice b and d both needs to cover their shorts when they needed to the same scenario can be played the other way around hedge fund a bought 1 share from bank b to cover and return to bank c hedge fund d then bought the same share from bank c to cover and return to bank e one share covered twice now imagine last week the price is above $200 you are a greedy ass wall st bank and you have a lot of gme shares on hand and a lot of shares loaned out do you 1 sell it to the shorts multiple times for ridiculous gain yourselves or 2 just shrug and let the retails take this cake the trading volume for gme is above 300m per week for the last 4 weeks with the highest week to be 550m the short float was 72m at its peak the trading volume is enough for them to cover multiple times every week have they actually covered your call fuck if i know we will find out in feb 9th
0,71,2021-02-10 22:46:30,youre missing another short squeeze play all of you smooth brained retards wouldnt shut the fuck up about gme long enough to read the small handful of tlry posts that smarter retards posted gme is finished shut the fuck up about it already this is wallstreetbets if i see one more longterm hold post about your fucking gme im going to throw poop at my wifes boyfriend get your money out make some fuckin plays and get those tendies back you fucking normies tlry is already up 70something percent in a couple of days and youre missing out because you keep masturbating to your massive red dildos from gme
1176,156,2021-02-10 18:09:57,battle plan listen up apes and diamond hands paper hands and shills should not reply this can be our chance to make a return to the table fist of all fuck the sec fuck hedgies and fuck melvin i have nothing to lose so lets do it this is for those who are on loss are not selling and are waiting for the squeeze 400$ either to moon or cover your losses as you have have noticed the new reports are out it may seem that the 120 is out of the table but apes still have a chance this will require work and dedication for those involved if the numbers apes have are any indication to go by apes still have a chance lets talk some numbers the reports are of a 7846 short interest yet apes can make some interesting math with other numbers the shares outstanding is of 6975m this is the reported total number of shares in gme this takes into account all shares including those of the company itself and private before the report 61m shares were being shorted this was at 35$ a share according to the bloomberg terminal that is what professionals use to invest it has now around 21m or more shares being shorted i believe its much more at this point this number surely has changed to a bigger number over the week x200b if ape can read keep going the graph below is not 100 accurate as this info varies from source to source you may have noticed this x200b this is the max pain theory what this graph tell us is that with the stock at 70$ or lower most owners stand to lose meaning there are more positions at that point and higher for buyers as you can see in red is the majority of the put or shorts this can also mean that most people would be profiting at the 120$ or higher share price and hedgies will be bleeding again at 120$ moar numbers for apes as of today gamestops institutional ownership is 8786 this number seems to vary from many sources the plot thickens the outstanding can be as high as 14368 according to the bloomberg terminal which usually the most accurate place to look at x200b x200b at the same time it reports a float of 72 this mean 72 of the shares are open to the market this can only mean that the outstanding is being manipulated by many maneuvers which surely includes the interest short and other factors this tells us that hfs are inflating the outstanding by many different means this can mean that the float is also inflated if they have inflated the outstanding so much to 14368 it makes difficult for then to cover the 7846 interest in fact it seems like a very hard task without having to buy it hard x200b now to the plan we need to grow the value above the max pain hitting around 120$ will possible trigger another big growth and squeeze x200b but ape is broke ape have no moar money x200b apes this movement have received global coverage what i investigated is that the biggest growth in value for gme happened during the time gamestop and gme were trending on twitter apes need to make twitter accounts and make the movement noticeable for the news again apes do it this works recapitulating outstanding is over 143 and the shorts are 7846 this means they are in a difficult position to cover their shares even if with an inflated float ortex reports a float of 45 which may or not be more accurate than the current inflated float on bloomberg according to the max pain if apes grow the stock to 120$ hedgies will bleed and have to start covering this will trigger another squeeze x200b the market closed at 5031 getting to 120$ is realistic if apes go on the attack x200b lets make the paper hand bitches that sold at loss feel the heat lmao x200b apes can do it again not financial advice im retaded
838,83,2021-02-10 17:44:33,hi melvin hi capital this is a negative post can i have some money please i hopped on the gme train quite early 95 33 dollars fuck man why didnt i sell at 480 why didnt i sell at 300 should have seen this coming well played hedge funds you have won i knew wsb was about losing money not making it it was just a conspiracy by this sub to hype up a stock then those hyping it sold at the top leaving all the people they suckered in to holding the bags just kidding buy and hold gme you fucking retards 76 short interest my arse melvin sincerely edit aahhhh hugs fanx
18,10,2021-02-07 05:51:36,a little story about $gme the year is 2050 a civilian is strolling along the city streets and notices a homeless man in a large coat with a hood over his head the homeless man is sitting on a park bench rugged clothes drenched and stained this man has evidently been homeless for quite some time our friendly civilian approaches the homeless man a single dollar bill in hand excuse me sir i dont have much to give i paperhanded gme back in 2021 but i hope this dollar helps the homeless man looks up through the grime and dirt on his face our civilian is still able to recognize him oh my goodness youre diamond hand dumbass indeed i am replies the homeless man he struggles to outstretch his hands as theyve become increasingly heavy from years of hodling gme shares he gratefully accepts the mans single dollar bill this dollar is more than i deserve my new friend says dumbass dumbass pulls out his nokia flip phone and dials up his broker yes id like 10 shares of gme the stock is now 10 cents a share he once again averages down his share price the friendly civilian looks at him completely astonished dumbass gets off the park bench looks to the man and before walking away musters up the unspoken phrase lost decades ago to the moon 
0,41,2021-02-07 05:38:03,this is how i feel about the whole gme things i feel like the diamond hand stuff is getting crazy if i were able to buy stock i am under 18 and my parents cant be fucked to make me a robinhood account i would have bought gme at the beginning and sold as soon as i saw the price going down call me paper hands all you want but isnt that the smart thing to do i was watching the stock guy on twitch the other day and something in chat resonated with me paper hands have paper am i just dumb and this is actually going back up or is it done because just looking at the charts it looks kinda dead to me tbh
1648,337,2021-02-07 05:11:45,overview of current gme situation its just getting started disclaimer i am not a financial advisor nor am i licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions i dont know jack shit about fuck this is not financial advice this analysis is not meant to influence inspire or inform you regarding your trades this analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect i found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion furthermore while these numbers are accurate as per their sources they may not account for other factors that relate to the stocks activity i own shares of gme tldr this is currently a war between funds your 141 shares dont move markets you little fractional bitch but if you sell at a loss right now youre literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot background gme is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds the combined top 10 institutions 10 funds own 8893 of the shares the 12204 of shares held by institutions is displayed here is old data and the current number is closer to 177 explained here the point is institutions and funds own almost everything retail owns almost nothing gme was already heavily shorted by late 2020 likely more than 80 of those shorts occurred at $4 or less late 2020 short interest data sourced from capital iq note on shorts when you short a stock you have to pay interest daily on that stock at the current price if the stocks price decreases you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest when the price increases significantly the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make early 2021 short interest data sourced from capital iq as you can see above in late january the price of gme kept rising and it likely became unprofitablerisky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices they likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding this leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts which led to the price rising even further which led to others trying to cover their shorts etc combined with retail mania this is what created the squeeze so the short interest goes from 10208 to 8858 and the price went from $3550 to $34751 now we know that the shorts were not covered i refer to this excellent post here as to how its basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered but theres another simple reason why the shorts werent covered who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53 of assets in a single fucking position the ultrawealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts but i guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadnt covered and that they had a new plan get an injection of cash from citadel and point72 $275 billion to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts and run a fud media campaign against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over while melvin waits it out the shorts have been covered anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron so whats the current situation 1 team a hedge funds these are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding some of them definitely covered and exited but its mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered these are the real bagholders they literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4 they need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed they need to buy the stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again 2 team b hedge funds these are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up they hold shorts likely in the $150$450 range on paper they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move they love these currently low prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit but they cant do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin because they shorted the stock they are also bleeding they will need to buy these stocks back eventually before their profit goes to nothing this could be a long long time 3 team c institutional holders and fund holders these guys basically hold all the shares that team a and team b hedge funds want theyre currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze team a and team b for every cent they have they know team a and team b are bleeding and that they must eventually buy back the stock especially team b since team b wants to actually realize their profits theyre comfortable sitting on their profits but theyre also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process they are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares they would love for the price to jump 500 sell 1 share keep 4 and continue bleeding team a and b whats happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds they are extremely intelligent extremely greedy and extremely competitive if a retard like me can dissect the situation they all have certainly figured it out as well whats happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions team a wants to cover but cant seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket team b wants to cover but cant seem greedy without eating into their profits and team c wants to sell and realize their profits but they cant all do it at once without tanking the price and you my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend when you buy high and sell low you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their lossesmaximize their profits the short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning this is not the end despite the fud and the shilled pessimism in wsb will it hit $300 again maybe not will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break evenprofit yes this is not financial advice i am not telling you to hold however you have already paid for your ticket to this show think about maybe sticking around for the ending

0,63,2021-02-10 17:48:33,what the si report told us two weeks ago the hegies were down 50 si on a poisoned stock wtf makes you think that they havent had a chance to cover their butts remember a week ago when the price held just under $100 all day that was big repositioning day for the hegies also and this is important the hedge funds are not required to buy shares to get out of the short positions not tomorrow not ever but for arguments sake lets say that they are still a week and a half later shorted by 80 is it reasonable to assume that they dont have a plan can you imagine how many apologies would need to be in the letter to their investors if they let reddit run them twice in the same quarter on the same stock in the same way that would banko a fund faster than any gamma squeeze could x200b get your head in the game x200b also it should be noted that the gme play is not and never was a war with the institutions and if it is small stacks are going to lose not big stacks god bless murica

41,49,2021-02-07 08:12:28,gme guide and common misconceptions gamestop guide nbsp i spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding gme and its future i am by no means a financial expert and i guess i am obligated to say this isnt financial advice i am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and i hate to see people get taken advantage of i dont know that i am 100 right but hopefully my post helps at least one person nbsp 1 was there already a squeeze by definition yes there was a squeeze according to the s3 partners estimates graph linked below the short interest on gme fell from approximately 69 million shares on 11321 to 2639 million shares on 2321 this means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions nbsp 2 what if the short interest data is wrongintentionally falsified more short interest data will come out on 2921 but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of january if you think s3 partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isnt anything that i am going to say that will change your mind nbsp 3 could there be another squeeze there is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero nbsp 4 what would it take to cause another squeeze since the short interest is significantly lower it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions based on the short interest chart below it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2121 in order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy gme bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares this was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 12521 through 12921 by an average daily price and adding them together i chose 12521 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now since the current short interest is significantly lower it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions nbsp common misconceptions nbsp 1 i lost 70 on my gme shares i might as well hold since its basically worthless this is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources there are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have there is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments nbsp 2 i should hold for the long play since i am down unless you purchased gme for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals this is probably not a great idea gme is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started $5 per share and even with the new executive leadership it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term nbsp 3 everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and i dont want to disappoint them people who are still holding gme and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money people telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling it is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up it is important to think for yourself and not just holdbuysell because someone tells you to do your own research and make your own decision this is not a family or a team this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves nbsp 4 i only lose if i sell you lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell the idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true nbsp 5 i should average down by buying more shares at a lower price buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares but it increases your exposure if the stock continues to fall you will lose more money nbsp 6 we did it before we can do it again the short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying we saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze i agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early however that does not mean that it can be done again there is no longer much media attention on gme and the attention that it is getting is not always positive nbsp 7 what about stimulus checks wont that cause another squeeze i would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into gme stock the media attention isnt there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over nbsp 8 all the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up everyone has a price that they will paper hands at some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still some people just bought in for the first time the paper hands traders are definitely not gone nbsp 9 by holding i am sticking it to the man while it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares you are not causing them extreme pain by holding there are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to nbsp 10 we are at insert place in the vw short squeeze graph this information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come the vw squeeze was very different to the gme squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading nbsp 11 anyone posting negatively about gme is a bot from the government or the suits im not saying there are no bots but this is not a real argument a lot of people who havent posted on wsb before were just lurkers the amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out nbsp short interest graph nbsp for transparency i believe that we have already seen the top of the gme squeeze and it will return to its old price so i have multiple gme put options that being said this post is not designed to make people sell or drop the price of gme only to help people make their own decisions as always make your own informed decisions based on the amount of risk you can tolerate

0,15,2021-02-07 06:20:58,second post about why selling 30 together will cause the spike and why gamma squeeze didnt happen i posted earlier about cutting loss on 30 on your gme together will do the magic so many of you called me retarded and think that holding 100 diamond hand will do the job it would have done the job if wall street didnt have the solution for it they avoided gamma squeeze like nothing do yall know how they avoided gamma squeeze they bought number of shares they needed to cover their naked calls before last friday thats why no gamma squeeze happened
17,9,2021-02-07 06:10:01,what the f is share lending  i read several comments and posts across reddit talking about not lending your gme shares for shorting but there seems to be a lot of misinformation or lack of understanding around this topic im not going to tell you what to do but only what it is most proper brokerages have share lending programs which you have to sign up for and only then they can lend your shares for shorting in return you get a part of borrowing fee which differs based on short interest these programs may have different but similar names in different brokerages such as fully paid security lending ally but are available in most brokers one of the biggest condition for the program is that security should be fully paid ie not on margin now we know most of retail shares of a particular popular stock are not on margin anymore brokers need to place a security cash deposit for you when borrowing your stocks since during lending you dont get sipc protection on your stocks a little conspiracy theory here during a short squeeze brokers that have lent out shates would be killed for that security cash requirement so that explains why they want to avoid squeeze anyway is it possible that you have signed up for such a program without knowing yes and that you can check by simply calling broker and asking about the program and telling to opt out of it you can also google your brokerage share lending program to find out what fancy name your brokerage has given so you dont sound retard when calling them to opt out of it one catch though wsb favorite robinhood doesnt have any such program meaning they can and they will lend out your security without your permission and without sharing any borrowing feeinterest with you and btw those rocketships in subject are to bring you to read this
0,39,2021-02-07 05:57:07,tought on wsb and what happened during the past weeks i only got here 2 or 3 weeks ago being on reddit everyday i was bound to find this sub when i got in the the sub the stock was at 20 bucks since deepfuckingvalue seemed to be the worshipped god of the sub at the time i got on youtube and watched his videos about it what my take was from listening to him was that gme was at 14 and the company was probably going to be worth 60 a share in the future he said it could even get to 70 if it does very well he didnt sold at 420 and im sure glad he didnt because i believe they could have gone after him now for the ape that diamond hand and all that please still hold i love that stock for real and i wanna see gamestop succeed in the future i could spend hours in that store when i was younger and i can see a brick and mortar store opened in big cities with a good chunk of online retails who knows they could become the amazon of games love you guys and love the sub the meme are amazing sir this is a wendys
372,114,2021-02-08 11:29:18,proper detailed dd on options for this week edit unity and peloton are still slipping while i still stand by them 100 getting in later today is probably a better idea i am sorry if you bought at 126 or so on unity though it is holding it but it should recover this week good evening gentlemen i present to those reading this a few options plays for this week that im pretty confident are going to print rather than holding losses these couple of plays will likely give consistent 50100 profits i edited out the nono words and crude jokes after automod keeps taking this downwhatever 1 chegg $chgg puts chegg has been running up to an ath ahead of earnings as noted in my last post their guidance generally falls short the stock is currently way overextended and with the somewhatnear reopening of schools there will be a damper on their growth projections im predicting a pullback to $95 or so suggested options 219 100105 put debit spread sell 219 $100p buy 219 $105p or purchase the 219 $90p 2 unity $u callssafe tendies editstill slipping today a bit advisable to wait until afternoon or so to enter position as you may have noticed unity software developer about 6070 of mobile games use their tech took a massive dive after earnings despite great profits and revenue their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction and it dumped 14 from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that importantly had several spikes to $140 there is still positive buying pressure even aside from the fundamentals of the stock guess who bought the dip cathie woods $arkk acquired a nice 764700 shares on february 5th mama woods is still confident in this stock as should youthere was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128 mobile games are still doing great and their revenue will continue to be strong this is a perfect dip buying opportunity and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on friday exemplify the buying strength it will return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives positions $u 219 $140c 319 $150c 3 peloton $pton callstrust the woods peloton was another company that had stellar profits but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections revenue increased 128 to $106 billion subscriptions increased by several hundred percent each for their connected fitness as well as digital subscriptions your wife getting heftier each day and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like aside do not forget they also are acquiring precor giving them a solid footing in the postcovid gym ecosystem what happened to the stock again like unity dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections it also nicely recovered during the day i managed to get in at $143 hehe tldr pelotons bottom line is not affected significantly their growth is explosive and continuing to rise cathie woods again acquired another tasty 106200 shares for arkw what does this mean if she buys the dip you need to buy the dip too suggested options 219 $150c 319 $165c 4 twitter $twtr puts as in octoberand julyand apriland februaryand the october before thattwitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10 why did it do this every time slowing user growth as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue they stopped running election ads meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time now people are likely leaving twitter in droves i had some info here about why but im assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after i say the name of the former president so im just going to leave it at that technical analysis its been running up to an ath the potential for it to dump right after earnings is insanely highall it needs is a slight blemish on projections and im pretty sure there will be many many scars on their projections on the flip side their profits will likely be very good thing is i simply do not see how banning the former president will help their bottom line and growth projections let me know what you think about this below suggested options heck why not 212 $50p for $93 you could do a longer date and higher strike but honestly either it dumps or it doesnt 5 arcelormittal $mt callssteel gang isnt done yet the reasons for purchasing $mt and other steel stocks such as $vale and $clf have largely not changed however most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $xs brief rocket to $24 before pulling backand then doing an offering the normal reasons still applydemand is high supply is low new infrastructure projects on the way etc this is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence and giving some momentum back to the stock plus the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low iv so it doesnt hurt to toss a little money at it but to be clear this is a much less assured play than the 3 i have already listed positions $mt 219 $23c for $66 could also just yolo a 212 call on wednesday at market close should cost around $30 each there are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well disney gm uberlyft enphase i might also do some weekly $dis calls and ride the runup to earnings and then sell before earnings as positive disney plus news might already be priced in with their investors day fireworks in any case i might post some more dd on other things i find and research only slight annoyance is that barely any people see these types of posts amidst the har dar gme give me upvotes because i spent 30 seconds making this meme
26,67,2021-02-07 09:59:01,to all the newbies still spamming about the gme squeeze and diamond hands stop believing the sub is compromised just because mods who have been here for 56 years remove misinformation about gme or a post that breaks like 7 points of the wsb content guidelines some mods have been removed yes but most of the old ones stayed and they are doing everything to get this sub back to pre gme standards this sub is not about gme not about an antiwallstreet revolution not about politics not about coordinated stock buying diamond handed newbie apes still not believing me just for christs sake read utheycallmeryan s post and stylux s comments below it they are both mods and they explain the situation perfectly and clearly
179,111,2021-02-11 21:46:27,gme thursday 2112021 we need a gme thread of positivity and absolutely buying the dip mods are if they remove this we all know whats happening and you cannot manipulate us if we didnt sell at $400 whats makes you think we will sell when clearly fishy things are happening and theyre trying so desperately to silence us it smells like money fuel up the rocket were going to see what pluto is all about 
127,104,2021-02-07 19:16:55,let me tell you about my weird ass dream from last night that relates to gme in a positive way i swear to god this is not me memeing but i chose the meme flair anyway because ill probably be wrong im telling you guys first but i had a dream last night where i was desperately picking some things off the ground yesterday and then suddenly i was literally dragged upwards like my whole body was reversed forcefully even though i dont think about my dreams too often i truly believe that my dream is a sign of the inevitability of gme mooning this week ive always believed in the inevitability of gme mooning to greater heights than the ones already reached thats why i didnt sell the shorts me picking up things desperately from the ground already know that theyre fucked and you can already guess what getting dragged up forcefully means us apes buying shares in the case that im correct im a fucking sage in the case that im incorrect i can just laugh it off in the end with you guys the dream was fucking weird and i needed to write about this tldr 
10,7,2021-02-07 16:41:44,why in long on mnkd credit to uyoyo_mas_cousin years ago while holding a true medical breakthrough mnkd who has an amazing inhaled insulin they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps they pretended that a led to b and it was all a natural process when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with bs fud seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game there used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable from sec data and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to mnkd but other favourites they used to attack difference with gme is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90 losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process and i believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share down 95 plus the naked short selling rule was called the madoff exception because bernie madoff helped get the rule in place to help provide liquidity to the market since then the markets have been completely rigged and it doesnt matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down they just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying gme should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise mnkd still kicking after all these years and seems to be finally winning the war but the majority of shorts already closed out after whacking the stock 95 good luck traders always check to see if your stock is a wall street darling or a wall street target the little guy cant swim up stream

18,157,2021-02-07 14:46:20,is $60 a fair price for gme if abusive shorts or diamond hands never happened my strategy is to try to dollar cost average down as close to $60 long term as possible im around $95 a share right now i dont really know how to value gme without all this chaos going on around it but i think $2060 might be fair since it seems whatever market forces lmao are moving the price right now wants it to stay between $60$70 i dont think it will go down below that unless a mass selloff happens for some reason if it does i think i should have at least 25 left over to invest to bring the average down closer to maybe $40 if it goes really south im new to evaluating a company from fundamentals i only understand market mechanics well by this point is this price range a resonable assumption what do you think about my investment strategy
247,81,2021-02-07 13:59:18,im feeling the need to point out the difference between covering and closing a short position edit what i describe below is called hedging covering and closing a short position are the same thing sorry for my mistake covering short positions does not equal closing short positions everyone doing math trying to prove that gme short positions couldnt have been covered seems to ignore overlook or not realize the difference no one said they closed short positions only that they covered they cover hedge using options short puts and long calls which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration meaning they spread the demand over months eliminating the squeeze leaving only slow upward growth edit i am long gme and diamondhand holding while i dollar cost average down and get ready for the long haul this is just good info for everyone to have not fodder for the hype train

38,98,2021-02-07 10:53:29,is melvin still shorting gme hey guys just want you all to check my smooth brain math and tell me what you think my understanding is that melvin capital held a short position of approximately 40 of gme shares or approximately 38m shares e 38m is a worse than worst case number 40 would be approx 28m also i dont even know where 40 comes from ive just seen it around reddit a bunch its probably much higher than reality melvin reported losses of approximately $6b in january well before the share hit $300 and claimed to be out of their position on the 22nd 26th when the shares were worth approximately $50 $150 but for the worse than worst possible case scenario lets use $300 share price and see if the numbers add up the formula for the interest calculation will be market value x rate x of days 360 i have seen the rates for gme reported at an insanely high 10 lets assume worse than worst case scenario and and call that 15 lets also not worry about complicated integrals and assume the price was $300 every day of january so $300 15 30 360 38000000 $142500000 last time i checked $1425m is a whole lot less than 6b using every possible worse than worst case scenario seems like their losses were probably incurred exiting their short position im pretty uninformed what am i missing

1899,277,2021-02-12 02:49:08,if you have a stock thats doing well long term dont post it here clearly you will lose money if you do so i have been running with few stocks that have done very good in the long run not amazing but a respectable 2030 bull run a week i have some research and dd done for them but a bit hesitant to even say the ticker name because of the absolute state of the sub i think what happened was a mix of different kinds of people after the gme conflict many new users have never seen gain bigger than 04 in their chase savings account so for them a gain of 1020 is absolutely massive and will get out as soon as they realize that gain because 10 is a once in a life time for them of course this leads to the conflict with the old retards that want to see 10000 in the call options and the new will alway win because its about 4m to 2m in number here in this sub this is not investments this is a get rich quick scheme i think this is whats not being understood by the newer people and what the older people dont understand about new people new people treat this sub as investment gaining 1020 a day is absolutely amazing so they take profit and buy dip etc nothing wrong with that i also would like to venture that there are definitely hedgfunds not large but small ones that have started to ride our the momentum for short term for stocks in this sub the massive volume in premarket is the first realization of this i know most of you old retards dont use anything like actual trading platform beside robinhood so youre stuck with market days only and im guessing 99 of the new retards dont even know you can trade af and pre market
122,187,2021-02-07 23:30:24,will gme actually go up i have seen a lot of data here i dont fully understand i see a lot of memes and a few conspiracies that may be true may not i would like to just believe it will actually go up again but im sceptic my feeling is that this are just a lot of people that dont want the hype to end and a ton of confirmation bias ofcourse i can be completely wrong the data seems convincing i guess but i dont actually know enough to evaluate that shit so you could probably convince me of anything using the same data so to the people that arent too emotional invested in this not giving a fuck about hedgefounds diamond hands etc do you think gme will go up again if so do you actually think its going to the moon or does it just go up to like 200 again edit i think there was a misunderstanding dont worry i didnt buy anything just wanted to understand the whole thing better and maybe decide to buy a bit afterwards i asked because the frontpage suggests that everything will go way up again which i didnt really believed
0,33,2021-02-07 22:37:11,i developed ptsd from gme watching the numbers going up and down seeing your money going away i had a loss of 80 from $1500 to $300 got in late in gme well turns out as i was playing a game where you have to adjust the settings to have the best efficiency of production defined by productsec i was getting ansious and my heart was accelerating just for watching the numbers increasing and decreasing in game it fucking sucks i tell you not so bad as that guy that used his dental school money to buy more gme tldr lost money and my sanity on gme
265,204,2021-02-07 22:06:43,gme shares are worth more than 2500 $ each i thought a lot about the current gme events what happened until now and what could happen in the near future x200b please consider that im just a retard and most likely just hate my wifes boyfriend im no investment adviser and i just love this stock x200b what we saw until now in a previous post we saw that two retards limit sell orders of 2500$ and 5000$ were successful in most media even the international ones there is a big emphasis on that gme squeeze is lost the media also strongly recommend to sell the shares learn from our mistake and move on as if they have our best interest in mind x200b what didnt happen until now the squeeze only the retards are currently the ones actively going for the squeeze x200b my hypothesis why only the retards went for the squeeze until now why other parties didnt went for the squeeze with us why are we encouraged to sell our shares who is going to buy the shares we sell only hf or other pois x200b imho the only correlation between most parties involved in gme events is greed and as long as the squeeze doesnt happen we should hold our shares especially the ones with lost porn most likely they are going to be the ones who will profit the most as it doesnt make sense for them to sell anyways the game is still being played and most likely the ones who are going to profit from this are the most retardedpatient holders holding 140 gme shares my estimate per share is 2500$ or above with rc and the new management at gme 450$ per share by 2023 is anyways reasonable

104,56,2021-02-08 03:05:32,gme si dd short interest clarification ive been following the short squeeze season since mid december and im interested in everything that has happened i was trying to find up to date short interest values for all of the recent redditwsbmeme stocks as cnbc and others like to call them i just wanted to share what i have found and i hope the information is valid im not looking to persuade anyone any one way im not a financial advisor this is not financial advice did i miss anything im an ape moon rocket diamond hands so i came across the finra 2021 short interest reporting dates found here finra requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month all short interest positions must be reported by 6 pm eastern time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by finra on january 27th trading became restricted by a few brokers for gme and other stocks on january 28th rh restricted trades for the entire trading session and many days after however on january 29th firms had to report their short positions this information will become public on tuesday feb 9th im not sure what time this will happen also im not sure what the position will show from the january 29 reports were the positions recorded at different times from different firms were they recorded at closing hours 6pm as well hard to tell regardless what i see as important here is that at some point tuesday feb 9th we will have an updated short interest value until then i wouldnt trust any sites values ie finviz which has shown the same 121 short float for the past 2 weeks because i assume they too are awaiting the reports from finra does bloomberg terminal have access to this information somehow after all this data was reported on feb 2nd so the information is out there somewhere i started a freetrial on and from a report on there i found the short interest values that were reported on dec 31 2020 and jan 15 2021 i have no idea what the short position will hold for jan 29th i also have no idea how to interpret the days to cover column if anyone can provide anymore information i will update this post tldr short interest values should be updated on tuesday february 9th not sure what time well know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then if it hasnt happened before then edit gme to the fucking moon apes update it looks like there were a reported 21409004 shares still shorted on jan 29th not sure what time that was taken most likely end of day or 6pm est this report is from ortexcom x200b x200b 
118,55,2021-02-08 05:39:41,market inefficiencies moass and you a discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us so the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market a basket of way over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market rh fucked 80 of the sub and now there is going to be congressional and regulatory inquiries so instead of yet another gme go brrrr post i would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is there is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this what that looks like we dont know yet but because the pdt rule exists i am pretty sure of that ironically the rule that is meant to protect retail definitely cost me more money when i was starting by trying to avoid strikes then any crazy yolos that brings us to the first point to consider retail options trading i am willing to bet large sums of money theyre going to come after it and while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading do we really have the effect that they will claim we have sure it can swing smaller stocks but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys remember how short lived that was on msft mass amounts of capital that we couldnt possibly bring to market are needed for that softbank did it though and that was a big dick move especially because they are asian and not known for packing schmeat the next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market hf leverage they were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history x200b seriously this is how bad it was x200b x200b graphic representation of overleverage using just gme x200b it might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk but the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits this being wsb i respect that but it was not retail that overlevered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close the market did not actually crash this time though and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now x200b baby dip but decent potential for upside maybe just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the hfs and ibs are using these types of events are happening more often than in the past the bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years dot com 2008 volmageddon covid crash and now this x200b i pretty much wrote this whole thing because i would really like to see some intelligent discussion here again and i am curious to see how fucked others think retail trading as a whole is when the suits do finally get together to discuss this i gave you graphs info and talking points so lets discuss

13,14,2021-02-08 04:06:02,exessive trading volumes in meme stocks in the following cnbc article here the article rh ceo vlad tenev stated with a lot of concentrated activity in some of these stocks in the same article the journalist writes robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading in the attached image i computed a comparison between nio which according some brokers was one of the most traded stocks recently and gme volumes among the period that goes from the 02jan20 to the 05feb21 it is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for gme are not even remotley close to the spikes in nio on the period i considered the maximun daily volume for gme which occures on the 22jan21 is just the 45 of the nios maximum daily volume of 577185100 also considerind the maximum 3day rolling sum of volumes gme is just the 41 of the nios above 1 bln exchanged shares computing percentage variations as lnvolumes_dvolumes_d1 gme shows the maximum peak on 314 but above nio of only 43 and not even in the hottest days of january 2021 but around october 2021 is it true that rh had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in gme feel free to consider my quick analysis as tons of bullshits but i will hold my tinydick position of 3 avg 150

17,31,2021-02-13 02:20:34,dont risk what you cant lose i am not a professional investor but i have been watching this community yolo for over a year this is just my personal take but the people telling everyone to sell and calling people bag holders dont realize that you dont risk what you cant lose the people here putting hundreds of thousands in have the ability to lose this cash and be okay its fun its risky but sometimes extremely rewarding no one was ever asking you to put in your life savings into the hands of wsb i can understand why some people are mad we all see the same hot posts what you take away from a dd post is your responsibility no actual wsb member lied to you or tricked you just told you what they think is gonna work the fact is though there are 100 shady tactics going on behind the scenes between the billionaire hedge funds anyone who thinks that the rich people arent doing everything they can to make sure we do not put them in a position like a couple weeks ago again are ridiculous the people on this subreddit are the same as you and me random people coming together to try and make money i have no clue how to invest or what a good stock is thats why we are here the ability to influence the market however small is possible with our community we saw what happened when reddit focused on gme but we didnt expect the repercussions from the hedge funds however the main point is this we are not here risking the money we need to pay rent would you bet your life savings on the super bowl if you find good dd and believe in a stock put your money in and be patient tldr do not bet what you cant lose no real member is trying to trick you there are billionaires going against us
1923,166,2021-02-08 15:22:48,yes laddering is real short ladder attack is just editorializing the laddering of naked shorts ive seen a lot of back and forth among those who want to handwave away price manipulation because the term short ladder attack is something google doesnt return much about x200b ladder is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates x200b legal laddering ex bond laddering can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments the idea is to separate cds cash bonds annuities and others into different ladders or buckets or baskets depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream lowrisk assets are used at the start of retirement and usually have an expected lower rate of return due to lacking a risk premium higherrisk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement this strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio with other assets in the stock market etc generally an initial investment of $10000$20000 is required in order to purchase 510 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline x200b short put laddering or bull put laddering is a unlimited profit limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term to setup the short put ladder the options trader sells an inthemoney put buys an atthemoney put and buys another lower strike outofthemoney put of the same underlying security and expiration date x200b illegal laddering ex ipo laddering also describes a process where in order to purchase shares at a given price investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price this artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price this practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the sec after the stock market collapse ok that was fun we know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in laddering we know that ipo laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price now in the more indepth version of the short ladder attack article written 6 years ago thats lately been passed around the author describes at length how naked shorts can be combined with laddering strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party this is effectively what the blogger coined as the short ladder attack strategy naked short this is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares in the context of this document a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company is considered counterfeit this is not a legal conclusion since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon todays rules the alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares which leads to widespread stock manipulationthe lynchpin of this massive fraud the anatomy of a short attack abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the dtc and major clearinghouses potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized the attack is planned to its most minute detail the plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they dont pay taxes on the illgotten gain click here for more on bankrupting the victim company when it is time to drive the stock price down a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers the playbook is very similar from attack to attack and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well tldr focusing on the terminology for short ladder attack is pedantic whats being described is the combination of a laddering price manipulation tactic combined with naked shorts both of those things are things im pretty retarded so i cant personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public or even those with terminal access youd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source yes the concepts described in the short ladder attack article are real things you can call it a number of things but its effectively a similar tactic to all laddering via shares neither party actually owns no that

229,215,2021-02-08 12:30:06,feb 9th gme short interest data i have some theories about the short interest data coming out 29 that will include shorts that have settled by 129 if shorts settle t2 and its only reporting shorts settled by 129 that would be trades executed 127 or before missing any data from that thursday fuckery by robinhood etc and the following friday with the all time high between 114121 it traded in a very tight range 38004400 with good volume could that have been people covering their shorts is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 122 trading day jumpwhich could of been caused by large shorts being covered and hfs booking losses if you go back to that week and search for news regarding gme by each day on 122 you see a giant spike in gme articles media talking about it jim cramer tweeted out 122 that gme was a squeeze of a life time etc this reddit blew up etc will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory but anyone who shorted the stock from 125127 is going to add to the short interest number in the 129 report any shorts established between 125127 made huge profits last week and could of been covered meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore because the market is reacting 100x faster to gme moves than it was prior to the 115 data is si data becoming less powerful as a predictor thoughts

30,119,2021-02-09 01:30:52,robinhood colluding with citadel to halt buying of meme stocks isnt the most likely scenario and other comments can go here if you want to see the other side this post is to offer a different perspective hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something thats still allowed on this sub 1 you really dont feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze 2 if you are one of those people that compares to vw thenwouldnt cohen joining the board be the catalyst and go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here zoom out on both charts looks like a short squeeze to me 3 there was no evidence before gme of robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors the ceo is a millenialthats not their thing 4 what there is evidence of is incompetence doesnt it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed unlimited fucking margin simply didnt have the liquidity to handle something like this and that the ceo is a fucking dumbass who didnt want to admit it on national tv 5 why would citadel even need to pressure robinhood to begin with they could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it 6 if you still believe citadel was behind this then rh isnt even the enemy in this scenario anyway itd be the dtcc that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100 7 if you feel that melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didnt then the silver lining is that this is blatant obvious and easily disproven they are being investigated so this would come out and itd be a big fucking deal which makes me doubt theyd lie about something they have no ability to cover up 8 you really should go look at other subs once in a while stocks stockmarket pennystocks and options contrarian opinions are allowed there if nothing else isnt more information before you make a financial decision a good thing disclosure ive had multiple positions on gme bought calls and puts bought shares sold covered calls using both shares and leaps as leverage i made a lot of mistakes during the run but have come out so far with about 150 profit could have been over 1000 if i played it a lot better

69,117,2021-02-09 07:39:36,you were always going to be holding the bags gme buyers were given two amazing gifts the first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two and the second was a loud psa telling you when the peak was in so you could sell at the best price i realize if the brokers hadnt restricted buying the stock could have went much higher but when they announced no more buyingonly selling even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that and yet some of you still held if it makes you feel any better you were always going to be the bagholder its a zerosum game every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else if you didnt sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top then you werent going to sell at $1000 or you would have at least bought back in weve all held the bags from time to time and it sucks but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves oh and the people being critical of you trying to pump gme a second time the ones you call shills those are usually wsb vets the ones telling you to diamond hand and to buy more youll notice that those are the new members those are the shills they desperately want you to pump so they can unload those bags on to you

96,144,2021-02-09 14:08:00,extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds the title of charles mackays book keeps echoing in my head as i watch the gme crowd continue to desperately milk whats left of probably the best trade this century a trade that should have been closed for 1000 profit 2 weeks ago a beautiful trade in its sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque greed fueled market delusions i have ever witnessed its become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation the likes of which hasnt been seen since trump convinced his supporters to storm the capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election while others that actually know better and understand what a bubble is ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy i feel like i may have played a very small part in this with my cnbc open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement as one retard here put it this is not occupy wall st this is wallstreetbets we fucking love wall st so with that said im making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as dd people claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the nyse there is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk everyone can do this including you every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their how to use options section people claiming shorts havent covered yet despite data released by the exchanges and s3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by warren buffet on a final note im going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here let me know if you recognize any of these 1 displacement a displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade 2 boom prices rise slowly at first following a displacement but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market setting the stage for the boom phase during this phase the asset in question gme attracts widespread media coverage fear of missing out on what could be a onceinalifetime opportunity spurs more speculation drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold 3 euphoria during this phase caution is thrown to the wind as asset prices skyrocket valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise and the greater fool theory idea that no matter how prices go there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay moreplays out everywhere for example at the peak of the japanese real estate bubble in 1989 land in tokyo sold for as much as $139000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of manhattan property similarly at the height of the internet bubble in march 2000 the combined value of all technology stocks on the nasdaq was higher than the gdp of most nations 4 profittaking in this phase the smart money the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting pointstarts selling positions and taking profits but estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because as economist john maynard keynes put it the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent 5 panic it only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble but once it is pricked the bubble cannot inflate again in the panic stage asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended investors and speculators faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings now want to liquidate at any price as supply overwhelms demand asset prices slide sharply one of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in october 2008 weeks after lehman brothers declared bankruptcy and fannie mae freddie mac and aig almost collapsed the sp 500 plunged almost 17 that month its ninthworst monthly performance in that single month global equity markets lost a staggering $93 trillion of 22 of their combined market capitalization gme is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security for those that bought under $40 well played you did good for those that bought over $300 and are still holding congrats you just played yourself and have brought shame to your family your village and all of china

506,122,2021-02-10 07:12:11,the 523 strategy a new way to invest for the last few months ive been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different ta indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls well no shit its something we all try to do i tried to keep it simple and experimented with ema and bollinger bands one trend that i found over and over again was when i used 5 day ema while following the prices day by day there were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off first the 5 ema would start by hugging the top bollinger band this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes to confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy i employed the 2 day ema to confirm in order for it to be confirmed the 2 day ema would need to break out of the bollinger band for roughly 3 trading days this was by no means an overall confirmation to invest the confirmation usually comes 15 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs we have 100 confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far lets take a look at some examples of the 523 strategy at work nbsp here is netflix in 2015 here is amazon in 2015 here is nvidia in 2017 also some other big investment things that i cant say on this sub have fallen into the 523 strategy nbsp and finally to another recent stock gme in late august 2020 the first spike occurred and was confirmed 25 months later the second happened and was confirmed then the price took off and probably couldve topped out at $5060 but the insanity took hold and the rest is history nbsp hope youve found this interesting id love some feedback and opinions on where i could do better
7313,2530,2021-02-10 05:18:03,tonights si report tonights report has been built up to be a make or break point for gme i want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data lets start with what we know about tonights report 1 this report is based on self reported data 2 the fine for misreporting if caught is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover 3 the data report covers up until the 29th so what are the possible outcomes 1 data is accurate hf covered i believe at this point gme becomes a long play there is the potential for an acquisition or a turn aroundpivot in the business model the play is buy dca and hold 2 data is accurate hf did not cover i believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can this would push up the price pushing more expiring calls itm and put further pressure on the hf we would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on the play is buy and hold 3 data is inaccurate this is the most likely outcome given the money at stake if it shows they havent covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data if it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call personally the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort expense etc the play is buy dca and hold in all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action the only reason to sell imho is if you believe gme will go bankrupt ok so im going to buy if i can or continue to hold what could happen that would turn this around 1 if not covered a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze elon cuban another hf etc personallyi have my tesla in my shopping cart already 2 if not covered gme reverse stock split this could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits 3 if not covered emergency shareholder meeting my understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote this initiating the squeeze 4 if covered or uncovered significant renewed public interest in gme a lot more likely if uncovered but its a strange world we live in so i wouldnt completely rule it out if they covered 5 if covered or uncovered gme public offering of 10 million shares at $x price we will say $200 this sets a bottom for the stock in the short term i believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around i am actually a bit puzzled why this hasnt already been done 6 if covered gme being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price this would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the gamestop name lives on 7 if covered gme makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape full disclosure i am currently down around 100k in my positions on gme in my mind the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesnt bother me to hold forever or until i win whichever comes first edit the report is supposed to reflect until the 29th update it appears the finra report officially states 7846

0,219,2021-02-10 09:02:51,gme squeeze has been squoze i believe so for now i am of the opinion that many of the hfs have covered their short positions this was more or less confirmed by the nyse short interest report published today as seen here short interest dropped from 132 to 46 from jan15 to jan29 edit short percent of freefloat dropped from 132 to 46 i pulled out of gme to stop the bleeding i know paper hands i entered at 321 since i have made some money back on gme puts the short interest report published today is a bearish indicator if you were planning on holding out for short squeeze im sorry to say that a short squeeze is less likely than before its unlikely that we will reach the same highs as before unless shorts double down again we will have to keep an eye on the short interest for the foreseeable future for now bearish sentiment around gme is indicated by the 278 putcall ratio today i placed an order after hours for a gme $50 put expiring on 219 not financial advice edit positions for those asking

4588,705,2021-02-11 10:53:53,the weed rally has nothing to do with gme no the upward movement in cannabis stocks is not a concerted distraction by wall street to take attention away from gme believe it or not but a global stock market can contain numerous trends all at once the weed stocks rallied because of the belief that broader cannabis legalization is possible in the next 1218 months under a biden administration remember the us house of representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last december only for that legislation to die in the senate still controlled by the gop now that dems have control of the white house and both chambers of congress cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization obviously that would be enormous for the marijuana industry so people are grabbing shares now ahead of the potential explosion in growth also a lot of these stocks were shorted and are now getting squeezed none of this has anything to do with gme
50,79,2021-02-11 10:19:47,the next gmelike short squeeze jfc peeps there will not be another gme for like a decade these kinds of things are legend for a reason youre not gonna catch em slippin like this again this happened because of a convergence of coincidences that no one foresaw it was dumb luck hence some were actually caught with their pants down and paid dearly for it and for you to be in on it in time is pure dumb luck squared to you retards who are trying to look for another stop trying to make retail short squeeze happen its not gonna happen especially just weeks after gme all the institutions know about gme and have reevaluatedadjusted their positions could this be another short squeeze no its bullshit tldr stahp it you retards _____ edit im not talking about the actual gme short squeeze or the short interest of it or if theres any juice left to it i am talking more about the circumstances from which it originated and how it is silly to say listen to articles or posts claiming there will be another short squeeze in a similar vain as gme
394,220,2021-02-11 09:16:29,pass the bong and gather round bros were gonna likeumwhat were we doing again oh yeah were gonna talk about those chronic stocks and how you ganja gorillas can avoid becoming game gibbons hay hay ay listen up b lemme holler at you a minute i notice you been eyeing that portfolio real luscious like almost like you found a couple extra bananas under your tree am i right x200b cool cool so whatchu holdin homey tillllllray aw yiss aphria yeah she fine as hell cgc oh lawd dat ass is bangin acb aw man you like the classics thats dope ogi into the up and comers respect young blood sndl x200b sndl for real dude x200b hi all nrdrage here you might remember me from such hits as pegging $gme dead right multiple times during its bubble making everybody rich on $riot exposing the $plug infinite money glitch accidentally helping start the $bb craze never getting an $amd weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the vix or maybe the sec and you how you can just say no to having them shove a mister fister up your ass alright apes its been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks you make money its been a great run but if youre going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with you gotta start thinking a bit and that means hear me out thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of sndl alive and yes i realize im saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours look i was playing it too i grabbed some 219 3cs and a shit ton of 122 15cs on tuesday i also got out of both of those today though not as high up as i could have if you check my history youll see i even said i was goingt to eye a reentry then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry but i passed on it because i had done some research by that point whatever profits profit x200b heres the tldr its basically a penny stock thats gotten pumped to hell but the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees x200b hey i love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy i aint gonna talk shit about that but it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this and im starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about holding to 4269 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly dont even know what they fuck theyve invested in that the gme gibbons fell for x200b heres the reality of sndl x200b the company was on the verge of bankruptcy around thanksgiving they have no other markets other than canada which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram and they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet thc content requirements x200b in case youre wondering what that means it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper they sell garbage and everyone knows it their brand is associated with low quality crap x200b plus they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering now to their credit this not only enabled them to become debt free but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand dont get too excited fucking sams choice at walmart is a brand too doesnt mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum by reason of them selling skunkweed their margins lag well behind that of their competitors x200b looking at their financials theyve got 615 million in cash laying around thats pretty good except theyre a company that burns 250 million a quarter which means theyre going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month theyve got no exposure to the us market but had no problem dropping rumors that they were going to break in to the us market through licensing deals which turned out to be 1 pot shop in bellingham washington they have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world for that matter x200b bbubububut nrdrage stonk go up look at it sndl to the moon x200b yeah i know its fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when its seemingly mid flight but here i am anyways not to talk you out of the weed party you should totally keep playing that for all its worth but rather to get people to see that theyve probably outgrown skunkweed now x200b look the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar hell it was 13 cents not too far back with a stock worth a dollar its easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz its easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere but as the price goes up so too goes up the perceived cost of entering i can make a strong unassailable in fact argument that $apha at $25 is cheaper than sndl at 325 but people are conditioned to like smaller numbers unfortunately as the gme gibbons learned eventually you run out of buyers and then things go tits up real fast x200b as the prophet biggie smalls once said mo money equals mo problems we all know this equation to be true and here you are sitting on bags of bananas you didnt know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadnt heard of before yesterday you dont think youve got a problem but you do because those bags of bananas arent edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash if youre sitting on bananas from the gold standard of the weed world that would be $tlry youre resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas there are gonna be lots of bananas to go around and mostly were just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later but you dont have that with sndl all the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher you cant all be right especially when there are billions of bananas and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some boomer on cnbc told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler x200b again im not telling you to leave the party x200b but if you recall your dorm room years the best pizza you could afford was the tonys school lunchroom style shit for a dollar then you managed to hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans and you upgraded to dominos maybe by now youre ordering from a local joint that makes its own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it that just makes it taste better thats science but i digress x200b the point is you can get better weed now you dont have to smoke the skunk so before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again maybe you should elevate your enterprise lets take a look at your options x200b canopy growth you could go with $cgc they not only sell higher quality weed but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think burning man isnt just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their luck theyve captured that all important 65 stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures cataracts and dry vag so theyve got a lot of revenue theyve also had a much more muted rise this week because they just havent been on everybodys lips which means theyve got a lot of room to run the downside here is they burn almost as much cash as sndl but theyve also got more bullets x200b aurora if you go with $acb youre going with a company thats already gone through its shady as fuck stage and has reemerged healthy from it youre also not only getting on weed but the diy urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed they too have had a strong run but have a lot more runway than most because theyve actually got a really strong path to dominance in the us market once it opens up to them x200b organigram x200b look if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or youve only got 28 dollars to invest you could do a lot worse theyve got strong branding large growth potential a management structure that doesnt seem to act shady and theyve run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit x200b tilray and aphria x200b im combining these because theyre inexorably joined at the hip or should be more on that later because the two of them are merging for those who dont know sometime in q2 every share of $apha you own will turn into 833 shares of $tlry even though apha is the one buying out tlry this is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery when you start investing in these you know youre a real investor x200b heres the interesting thing with these guys though even though aphia should be just slightly trailing behind tlry in terms of stock price its currently trading at less than half with tlry sitting at 73 a share as i write this apha should be at just over $60 but its at 29 now obviously this means that tlry has a lot more momentum and some of that is due to the fact that theres a mini dont flog me for using the word but its true short squeeze going on with that one which has turned it into such a strong momentum play but apha by virtue of actual math needs to be within about 17 of tlrys price which means apha either needs to moon dramatically or tlry needs to fall precipitously now either of those things could happen but the momentum of tlry is hard to stop which means its more likely that apha rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months even if tlry does falter that means apha still has to come up a bit to meet it making apha kind of a cant go tits up situation tlry also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it whereas sndl is too small to meet most of their requirements which can further propel tlry and thus drag apha with it x200b one of the interesting things thats been happening with this pair is that the order books even though they should mirror one another have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days this of course was a bull flag for tlry every time it happened leaving apha to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter its really easy money x200b fundamentally these guys have one huuuuuuuge advantage over the others they secured the uk distribution and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them and if you dont think they wont be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the us opens for business then you definitely aint black x200b or you can just stay where you are and do the thing x200b ask the $gme gibbons how well that worked out for them the ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the viper room still rocking his mullet and chain wallet just convinced that warrant and slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again its just sad youre flying right now but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then youre gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that its gonna be ok and that youre gonna ride it to a thousand one day lots of us myself included made a fuck ton of money on gme and weve made a fuck ton on sndl and the rest of the weedies this week but there are always people who melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck thats gonna be a lot of you but you shouldnt let it be you x200b tldr smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from sndl while youre way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes plaintains equals breeding with better apes not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases x200b all my love x200b chad dickens x200b x200b

9405,1246,2021-02-10 19:10:46,why this is just a beginning a guide for the gme gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation listen up you fucks for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works some of you might remember me when i told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ when msft deal happened by my dd about why gamestop is worth 138$ or by my other posts ive made here for months as youve noticed i love the stock ive held through 90 at the lowest to 10000 at the highest and i continue holding im down $300k from the ath at this point and i dont fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over now get these points through your thick head this is a fucking volatile stock this is how it goes it shoots up gme gang rejoices a bunch of retards buys at the top then it crashes down for a while keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze rinse and repeat every time it shoots up it does it more violently the amplitude getting larger and larger and every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier i wish i bought at $9 when it shot up to $13 and them came down i wish i bought at $11 when it shot up to $20 and them came down i wish i bought at $17 when it shot up to $70 and them came down i wish i bought at $40 when it shot up to $150 and them came down i wish i bought at $60 when it shot up to $450 and them came down being in gme gang was always about not caring about temporary swings because in the end the price always sets a new ath ive seen this shit happening so many times since october that i just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 56 digits gme was never a squeeze play despite what a lot of you retards think read any dd more than a month old the whole company is massively undervalued read about ryan cohen a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark once he sets his mind to something he will never back down thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at gamestop formed of matt francis cto former engineering leader at aws kelli durkin senior vice president of customer care former chewys vice president of customer service josh krueger vice president of fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at amazon walmart and qvc do i need to mention reggie filsaimé of a fucking nintendo i am a firm believer that cohen will manage to grow gamestop at the very least to the size of chewy $45bn market cap guess what gme has $4bn thats 12x bagger and im being very conservative here this is not about squeezing the hedge funds this is about the company establishing its true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the s the true price for me is conservatively the size of chewy which translates to $650 i know i said $138 in my previous dd a few months ago but it was before all the recent news of ryan cohen taking over with his starteam moass was a cherry on top and still is on the table not the main play also gamestop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019 tesla had $24bn think about it for a moment short interest is still through fucking roof i know youre used to 100 si and the new 41 number does not quite gets you off but its still fucking abysmal vw ostk happened on less than 20 also keep in mind that this number is for 129 literally the top when a lot of shorts covered it does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which i guaranfuckingtee you was massive just wait and see the next report with increased si the shorts never learn tldr gamestop is still undervalued conservative pt is $650 ambitious $1200 assuming ryan cohens success which i dont doubt for a single moment short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $tsla squeeze with wild swings along the way old shorts will cover new ones will pile in because the blockbuster narrative is still strong this is still a risky gamble no such thing as a sure bet but the riskreward is massively skewed to the upside if you have shortdated calls you might be fucked might be not if you have shares or leaps just get away from screens for a while if its unbearable for you but ultimately youll be fucking loaded this is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000 and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paperhanded bitches in the comments scream wow he fucking held gratz positions some apr 40c some apr 200c and a shitload of jan 2023 950c will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open
573,118,2021-02-10 18:51:28,nyse v offexchangefinra short volumes for gme short volume in public exchanges wasnt even half of whats needed for 150 drop in short interest the drop in si from 226 to 78 required around 100 million shares to cover shorts but the nyse only saw 49 million short volume while offexchanges saw about 3x as much got the daily short exchange trade data from nyse now so i can compare it to the finra numbers that ive been using in the past general bullet points below tldr check bottom look at figure 1 and napkin math x200b publicly traded stocksgme on the nyse can be traded upstairs in offexchanges otc but have to be reported or should be daily short sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day short sale trades done on nyse are not in the finra data and vice versa the good stuff is in the monthly short sales files and it isnt out yet for january x200b to start out we can compare the total volumes for gme across the public exchange nyse against the offexchange finras numbers figure 0 i dont have all the volume as yahoo reports nearly double what nyse and finra are reporting missing volume was added to show yahoonysefinra disclaimer no idea where the missing volume is from but its not on the nyse and not being reported to finra does yahoo count volume some other way i sure as hell didnt know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges but we got data now notice how it really doesnt pick up until the 13th though and it seems to be settling down as we get further into february x200b figure 1 comparing nyse to offexchange short volume with respect to gmes float figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the gme float in the offexchange x200b figure 2 short volumetotal volume from finra and nyse daily short volume files respectively figure 2 shows us that around 50 of all the volume no matter which exchange is around shorts even before jan 13th jan 19th 26th see how the nyse actually leads in short volumetotal volume on those days which were also the same days that gme shot up toward $400 x200b next i wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bimonthly reports for gme and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the offexchanges x200b finrajan 4th15thjan 16th29thfeb 1st9th

volfloat028105041 now lets use some of these numbers to check some reports napkin math time 1 so 226 si for around jan 15th and were at 78 si reporting now from end of january 2 22678 150 3 150 short interest 150 shortssharesoutstanding 4 shares outstanding 70million 5 70million 150 105 million shorts were settled from 15th to 29th ok i can believe that 105m shorts went through because thats when gme went up to to $400 the only thing is and heres the kicker of the 100million shorts only 49 million were executed on the nyse during jan15th to 29th we still have 55 million shorts that were executed those two weeks and in the finra exchanges we can see the155 million short volume but howwhere do they do this offexchange trade you might ask right on your damn phone urist mcpaperhands for market makers with a customer order to sell they will temporarily sell short which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination and then immediately buy from their customer in a nonmedia transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double counting share volumes otcmarketscom if you sold gme via any of those apps chances are they bought up those shares themselves after they used them to cover their shorts the rest of the shorts are just in the ether of otc exchanges granted i cant get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed how many started to juggle around with options but we do know that before tonight the si was above 200 and has been updated to 78 i believe that the update is referring to data at the end of january correct me in comments tldr 1 nyse sees only 15 the volume that offexchanges do regarding short volumes for gme 2 short exemptsare nearly twice as prevalent in the nyse than otc 3 only half of the shorts were executed on the nyse to decrease si from 226 to 78 4 still waiting on finra for the finra monthly short sale file x200b not advice of any kind i should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit and i miss chewy runts edit usolvethisproblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for si in the post i used shortoutstanding shares yahoo finance to calculate the 226 to 78 si change however morningstarfinra use shorts float which is outstanding shares insider holdings untrading lnst holdings

46,28,2021-02-12 05:53:36,the retail trader wave  these last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what up coming companies to put my money on at the moment i am feeling that i would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on the gme gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot probably this is just a short term distrubance though it could be a continual change i really dont know so what has happened part 1 gamestop gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard tens if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief you see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy they had over extended and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation how lucky we all now were we simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket powered by the elites lost money it was irresistible it was a promise not only of immense wealth but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times this of course didnt end as most people expected the elites escaped their fate the early traders made millions most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could part 2 the fallout so suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading they had only two questions on their mind what stocks are the next gme which of these winning stocks can i afford and win the most these two questions inevitably led them to one place the penny stocks also stocks under about $30 though most of them couldnt access all penny stocks just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms part 3 thesis i am doing away with the story like tone of this now though i hope you enjoyed that essentially a ton middle class people that dont have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next gmebig thing and many have just been following trends on mass the issue with this is there is currently seemingly high quality dd posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10 and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10 i imagine because of this many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now 1 it is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave 2 many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been so i am left wondering how far they will recede back if at all and when should i buy back in i am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation personally these are the steps i have taken i have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from gme from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains i have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments most into a few different etfs some into sq microsoft apple though i have kept a small amount an amount i have no problem loosing and i chucked it into a tanzanian gold company stock why you may ask have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company simply because it was one of the last widely accesbilethat is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms penny stocks under $1 i suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is stocks under $1 seem at least temporarily to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1
1351,501,2021-02-12 04:47:42,sndl and a warning to all penny stocks futures post gme hype this is not financial advice this is strictly an opinion based post tldr postgme wsb became a pack of brainless wolves who hunt down penny stocks and spam the yahoo conversations with the same tired lets take this stock to 10011 the group retardation is exponential when you also hear shit like im down 100k but we were still going to the moon not only retarded but gluttons for punishment its as if losing money somehow temporarily boosts your group think morale before you reality sets in and you realize theres no way back out do you even know how a company is valuated you can artificially pump all you want it doesnt actually make the company worth what youve inflated it to i cant believe i have to explain this but for serious investors in this who have done their dd would project to sell at a set point if theyre risk averse anything beyond that point is pure volatility a stock like sndl would never organically hit $100 with the current state of their business even with you retards pumping it up artificially it would never hit $100 anyway because any reasonable person would start dumping once they see the kind of manipulation is at play case and point the events of sndl this fucking morning do you still think itll go to $100 i used to take the word retard being thrown around here in jest but now im pretty convinced that the folks as mentioned in my previous example above are unironically retarded is this going to be the new thing now every penny stock going to be pumped and dumped you realize by doing this youre no fucking better than the hedge funds you purportedly hate youre acting as a hive mind to inflate then dump this is why i think post gme wsb has and will continue to decline unless something is done about this so for those actually looking to invest wisely here if you ever see a penny stock being posted with no dd or futures to back it up do yourself a favour and avoid the risk yes you can probably get real lucky and ride the short term wave then dump but if youre wanting to be a serious investor just ignore the bullshit posted here making money is fun until you lose it all on a more sober note sndls futures are somewhat hopeful my personal opinion based on some potential acquisitions so i will be sticking around for a little bit am i taking a risk yes this is still a speculative stock and fortunately i dont gamble away a mortgage for something like this
2645,463,2021-02-12 02:47:03,stock market 101 youre on your own because this subreddit has turned into teaching finance while babysitting id like to make sure you guys understand something theres no such thing as paper hands vs diamond hands this isnt some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing paper hands are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags now depending on the situation they might not leave bags and people with diamond hands make more money sometimes paper hands are right that is because drum roll its all about supply and demand this is especially true in options because they are zerosum that means someone will come out a loser this idea that if we all hold the line then the stock will keep going up is simply untrue this isnt your modern dodgeball where everyone comes out with participation trophies someone will be left with the bag and that will be you if you dont start being skeptical and selling the top there are people that fomod into weed yesterday this is the result of people thinking stonks only go up last note lots of you i mean lots of you entered into the stock market for the first time due to gme your first impression is that all hyped stocks will go from $4 to $450 not at all true what happened with gme is a once in a decade play whether you argue its alive or dead isnt the point stop speculating that every stock will be like gme and lock your damn profits
644,190,2021-02-12 02:32:57,stock trading for dummies 101 take your profits and get the fuck out of these high volatility stocks its fine to ride the train up but please for the love of god set a stop limit or a trailing stop ive been apart of this community for over a year but just started investing im going to give the new people some advice 1 research the company and see if their valuation matches the current share price 2 pay close attention to all the comments on whatever youre investing in its not hard to tell the real people from bots most bots will tell you to hold the fucking bag while they run off with your money 3 if its too good to be true it usually is im not telling anyone how to spend there money but please only invest in these high volatility stocks with the future of the share possibly tanking 4 dont let high volatility stocks take up a majority of your portfolio ive seen advice where people say one stock shouldnt take up more than 1020 of your portfolio 5 this one is a big one if you see people hyping the fuck out of a certain stock there is a good chance there will certainly be a sell off once people start seeing huge profits it dont hurt to take profit and buy in at a lower price definitely use risk management to make sure every trade is worth it 6 dont day trade you will lose more money than you make in the long run if you plan on investing short term have a strategy invest in options that have good deltas and iv these are certainly risky but if you like gambling on shitty shilled stocks this one is for you 7 if you want to go long invest in etfs sure these will see lower gains but over time the gains will be decent if you want to go long on equities make sure you love the damn stock so many people see red and sell this is fine if youre using risk management and need to exit but horrible if youre trying to make money without a lot of capital 8 learn learn and learn learn from every mistake you make and better yourself for the next trade i was a bag holder with gme i lost about $600 know which indicators lead to the stock moving in a certain directions you think it will breakout what will the catalyst be always strive to learn more than the previous day tldr trust your instincts not random people on reddit who a majority are bots and shills you can definitely learn from people on here but youre picking a needle from a haystack youre here to make money for your future other people are wanting to fill their pockets so expect misinformation take everything with a grain of salt

980,396,2021-02-13 09:11:43,i cant believe i have to say this but a lot of people need to hear it the stock market isnt fair all i read now on new wsb is about how robinhood stopped the gme squeeze and they robbed investors this was going to $1000 we got robbed is every other damn post now personally i dont buy that this is all a big conspiracy and that all the brokers halted trading to save one hedge fund as a long time trader who has witnessed a lot of halts it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked and they protected themselves but i wont get into that because thats not the point of this post this is the point the stock market isnt fair never has been never will be for example 1 big money has access to so much information you dont have they have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune they have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate is that fair 2 big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals and similar and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you is that fair 3 big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing that autotrade for them is that fair 4 big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buyingselling they can rotate between stocks and etfs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing is that fair i could literally write a 500 point list but my point is clear the shit aint fair its no secret as a retail trader you are a little guppy punkass bitch in a big dick shark pool but we all know that its never been about being fair its about profiting from the landscape that we are in if you buy into gme at $50 and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days then you see some sketchy shit happening and think wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry its not fair then youre a fucking idiot im sorry but thats the deal we know big money has the power to crash a stock so if you see it happening sell better yet sell and switch to shorts and play both sides dont lose all of your money and then claim the market isnt fair no shit it isnt fair whats your point profit off that unfairness ya dumb bitch the millions of new wsbers all posting about how it isnt fair and we got robbed its basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money hey no shit criminals do that if youre a crime boss you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him thats how it works and thats how it works here too in the criminal world people lie to you in the stock market big money manipulates shit you can punch the sky or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind when i am in a trade sure im thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance the news cycle all the boring shit but im also thinking about big money retail traders who is involved and how they are involved and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price you have to because thats how the market ticks you only win by playing by the rules of the game and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors and youll never have even 1 of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has dont fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus play the game am i being negative nah im being realistic you want to fight to make the market more free and fair go on fight to make it better its a good thing to do and i support it and ill help you but in the meantime accept what the market is right now dont throw you and your familys money away as a moral martyr saying well i wouldnt have lost all my money if the market was different its not different it is what it is and if you legitimately cant disconnect yourself from that idealism then its probably just best not to trade for your own sake

977,118,2021-02-19 14:06:18,my main conclusion after watching the hearing no one is on our side they want robinhood to be the scapegoat and fall on their sword so the real issues can be ignored tldr no one gives a fuck about us the game is rigged and changes will only make it more rigged all you can do and all you need to do is buy hold and consciously think fuck you to our political system every day i had to watch the hearing after the fact tonight there were definitely some fun points and i gotta admit it was fun seeing vlad get grilled that said while i didnt expect anything huge or concrete from the politicians i was going into this vaguely hopeful that there could be some real support for actually uncovering things wall street did and how we were screwed guess im still naive to me it looks like most of the two parties are trying to take these lines dems all these retards are retarded vlad youre a piece of shit who let retarded people ride a regular bus but they obviously belong in a short bus we need to burn robinhood to the ground then create laws to keep these retards where they belong repubs robinhood youre a real piece of shit but gosh i cant hate you too much youre stuck in these stupid regulations from the dems what we really need here is too free up wall st to do what they need and want to do did you know retail cant even buy unregistered securities obviously thats what got us here in both cases we get screwed this shit happened because wall st manipulated markets sold naked shorts and handcuffed retail when nothing else worked now we get david scott asking if robinhood had any way to monitor social media and block trades what the absolute fuck how is anyones conclusion from this that we need to put more restrictions on retail traders for that matter how does anyone see this and think the issue is too few restrictions on wall st there were a few representatives asking decent questions but they werent leadership and they werent the majority of either side my main takeaway is neither side gives a fuck about the actual issues here everyone is focused on grabbing a little political capital by acting as a mouthpiece for populist anger then doing more to make the situation worse before i get into this next point let me first say fuck robinhood for so many reasons not just the restrictions on buying meme stocks that said robinhood is not at all the underlying issue here they didnt use news organizations to try and push fud to push prices down they didnt short gme at 140 they didnt use ladder attacks to drop the price they didnt raise their own capital requirements but that hearing was just everyone painting robinhood as the evil behind it all both sides shat on vlad for legitimate reasons and fucking retarded reasons like the fact they dont monitor social media to block specific trades then after shitting on robinhood they pivot to their real target which was either more restrictions on us or less on the people actually behind everything bad here literally the only fucking person there on our side udeepfuckingvalue and he said hed buy so you know what to do

138,27,2021-02-17 01:02:31,gme cmkm i was researching if anything like gme ever happened in the past and came across the canadian stock ticker cmkm that traded in the us from what i have gathered a bunch of stock holders purchased this penny stock hoping for a big pay day on a rumored buyout and short sellers got squeezed the sec halted trading because of an extravagant amount of failure to deliver and traders were required to request certificates from their brokers and it was discovered there was a large amount of counterfeit stock this is from 2006 this happened and is still being litigated to this day i only know what you can find with google as this is before my time so if any boomers are here maybe they can chime in if there is a large amount of counterfeit stock what is to prevent this from happening today if the squeeze does happen who is to say they wont halt trading and then its discovered some shareholders arent actually shareholders seems like the shareholders both won in this case in that they were right and lost in this case as the sec froze trading and its still being litigated 16 years later

55,20,2021-02-18 18:57:03,t2 and why citadel is winning tomorrow looking through the prepared testimonies for tomorrow you will notice that for good reason there is a paucity of discussion regarding the mechanisms behind the price action of gme and from vlads testimony a great deal of discussion regarding the mechanism of factors that contributed to trade halting one factor that keeps being brought up both by rh and citadel is the logistics and capital requirements of delayed settlement enter t2 as an uncertified crayoneating degenerate the concept of delayed settlement is something that i was vaguely aware of but didnt really care about because as long as the tendies are on my dashboard who cares what the wendys kitchen looks like and for the majority of the lowlifes here it likely has minimal impact in the way you trade unless your margin yolo goes horribly horribly wrong but for the big boys its a bit different for the children who are hopping in for the first time imagine a scenario where a bunch of apes are trained to gamble in a casino with chips each game is played chips are moved around second by second but the apes dont materially walk out with changes in cash money until you trade the chips for money the casino is taking care and tracking these things for you and you dont think about it too hard because you walk away with what youre supposed to but the pit boss is always watching whats going on and moving the cash in the back to make sure things run smoothly historically this delay measured in days helped the boomers and ancient folk settle the paperwork involved in trades and has continually gotten shorter over time t2 is actually an acceleration of the settlement process in 2017 the sec finalized their move from t3 to t2 as standard for most market transactions yes theres variability and some are already on a t1 schedule but for the most part thats where we stand so why does it matter why does citadel and their hand up vlads puppet ass focus in on that as the intervention that the likely paid off investigatory committee should focus on while i dont have the internal data to support it in theory and even as stated previously by the secs own press release having acceleration of the process to keep up with technological advances has a number of benefits again why does this matter to you and me i doubt you notice it much to the big boys it means a lot at that macro level liquidity gives you volume and volume gives you profits by reducing the barriers to settling trades they can minimize risk to margin improving liquidity and thereby allowing them to perform more trades per unit time in the grand scheme if this goes as planned citadel and other mms will likely come out ahead in this case the few billion they had to pay is likely a reasonable price for having a push to t1 where they can theoretically continue to accelerate their capital growth on the scale of tens of billions of dollars over the coming years melvins got their panties in knots and rightfully so for getting completely fucked but citadel may yet come out on top from all this tldr i think citadel will try to convince the panel to make moves towards a t1 standard itll speed up their transaction process and print them more and more money itll sidestep any actual regulation to help retail but also avoids looking overtly like theyre bullying us positions i dunno stonks only go up edit 1 1145 pst and here it is from loudermilk its a clear setup blame the market freeze on the collateralmargin regulation vlad agrees then kenneth lines it up to say how t1 helps everybody but some everybodies more than others edit 2 1320 pst pretty consistent trend amongst the republican representatives to blame settlement regulations to cause the trading halt i honestly wasnt expecting this much spontaneous grandstanding from the questioners but i suppose theyve been preparing for this for some time now
433,119,2021-02-18 18:36:54,so this guy is mad because he lost hi bet and has set up a class action against keith gill im sorry but what is wrong here he put down a bet and lost and now is suing keith gill with a class action securities suit stating he lost a shit ton of money because he had to buy back call options at elevated prices im sorry but isnt that the risk of the call options you placed i dont think he also researched properly i dont ever recall keith saying or recommending go buy gme from what i can see he just stated what he did his position and his reasons it seemed pretty open to me ive lost a a lot im still holding because why not at this point im not trying to sue anyone for my decisions im pissed at rh for single handedly shutting out customers for something they didnt manage themselves properly but thats a separate discussion source 
175,72,2021-02-18 17:54:52,fundamental error in the docket for the lawsuit against dfv out of interest i looked up the docket for the case against udeepfuckingvalue and there seems to be an incredibly smoothbrained error in it regarding the dates of the naked calls the plaintiff sold docket part iv d 61 says 61 plaintiff sold call option contracts representing 2000 shares at a strike price of $100 on january 26 2021 with expiration date of january 192021 while gills manipulative social media conduct drove the market for gamestop shares into an unjustified frenzy above $400 so he sold calls naked calls it seems on jan 26 with an expiry date of jan 19 could he please teach me how to do that also this link shows that on jan 26th gme opened at $8856 had a low of 8020 high of 15000 and closed at 14798 above $400 is irrelevant to his case however he claims to have been forced to pay $300 and $315 per share i assume to cover his naked short i can only assume that this means his options were exercised automatically by his broker afterhours and that he simply didnt bother to buy the naked calls back before close on the expiry date when they were less than half of that 63 because of the market frenzy caused by gills manipulative conduct and mmls and massmutuals failure to supervise plaintiff was forced to cover the options contracts by purchasing back offsetting gamestop options contracts representing gamestop shares at unwarrantedly and unprecedented inflated prices of $300 and $315 unmoored to the true value of gamestop shares causing plaintiff to incur substantial loses if anyone can explain otherwise please let me know additionally part i 1 in order to disguise that the aim of his socialmedia campaign was simply to increase the worth of his gamestop shares by creating a demand for the stock gill took on the fake persona of an amateur everyday fellow who simply was looking out for the little guy so he thinks that people are more inclined to follow the advice of an amateur than a professional interesting approach if i was building a house i certainly wouldnt take the advice of joe next door over that of a professional builder but maybe he would there are several other parts which also make me go huh but so the automod doesnt spam me ill finish here im just a smoothbrained clown but the plaintiff and his legal team seem to rival my level of mental incompetence tldr the lawsuit claims he sold naked calls with an expiry date one week prior to purchase and several other weird argumentserrors
45,4,2021-02-18 13:42:02,one could say there is something about this security i fancy down more than 500k still holding x200b disclaimer i took a bunch of profit few mil already these are some shares which i was trading during the squeeze which i decided to yolo and hold long term as a tribute to dfvcohen and gang x200b not expecting any squeeze type event to happen but hoping that ryan cohen doesnt bail and delivers on at least trying to execute parts of his proclaimed prophecy i think even if gme can show they are in the midst of transformation whether successful or not the stock will at least go back to a $89b valuation after that its all up to how the business actually performs mid 2022 onwards im confident that given gamestop has just had one of the greatest global viral marketing campaigns in history there will be significant new interest in the brand x200b im looking forward to starting to get actual fundamentals related catalysts once again as the year progresses i miss the days of waking up to announcements such as the microsoft customer ltv revenue share agreement x200b basically holding long term have faith in the original thesis 
160,46,2021-02-18 12:09:08,three big issues for february 18 congressional robinhoodgamestop hearing 1 why such a high failure to deliver was it largely due to hedge fund naked short selling 2 why was robinhood allowed to unilaterally change trading rules and severely restrict trading in gme midstream severely limiting when how and how many gme shares could be traded effectively not allowing retail investors the ability to add to their gme positions robinhood essentially took control of the trading platform and rigged it in favor of itself its clearing agents and the hedge fund community 3 finally what justification was there for numerous other brokers to simultaneously put similar restrictions on gme trading with their retail investors was it in effect blatant collusion with robinhood the clearinghouses and the hedge funds these are the questions that must be answered to establishreestablish institutional credibility with retail investors

40,38,2021-02-19 12:11:25,borrowing shares the conundrum a regulation i would actually agree with watching the hearing today and just thinking about how and why short selling exist in the first place all revolves around borrowing shares from owners many people i know and talk to dont realize that your brokerage pretty much has the right to borrow your shares to short as they see fit unless you contact them and disable it this is typically done on margin accounts where you actually dont really own the shares that you have on margin until you can cover your position there are also brokerages that will lend out your shares with out telling you some will ask you to allow them to borrow at a percent return but we all know thats a pretty shitty statement when those shares are typically used to force the price of the stock down resulting in a net loss i propose a regulation that every broker needs to have an on off switch for every position you currently hold in order for you to allow a share to be borrowed or not this also needs to be accompanied with the current borrow interest rate on your borrowed stock as a return percentage you own the stock and can make an informed decision as to whether or not you are willing to take the risk of allowing someone to take and short your shares with out you knowing seeing the ibkr reports throughout the entirety of the gme process absolutely blew my mind when seeing us burn through a million short shares a day and then another million would appear the next day and wed do it again we have the rights to our shares and our brokers shouldnt have the right to a borrow them with out our knowledge we should have to optin to this practice instead of having to jump through hoops to optout justice for dfv

785,109,2021-02-19 06:21:28,its clear to me members of congress are appealing to the popularity of this sub one guy said deep you know what value another guy joked about diamond hands one other even outright said what we all suspected this is just political theater you might find this funny but realize that this sub wields very real political power some of these congressmen get elected on margins of a few thousand or tens of thousand votes this sub and this very issue and whether we get our deepfuckingfried tendies could literally decide whether they are in office the next term and determine whether democrats hold onto their majority so all we really gotta do is shout out the questions we want answered and the solution we want and make our displeasure known with the members who were completely inapt at doing their job my questions how did dtcc come up with 34bn and how does it compare against other stocks who drove the price down right after suspended trading where are the ftd stocks who ftded them and why solution open book on all gme and xrt trades from all counterparties and a crayon graph explaining all
3951,289,2021-02-19 05:15:40,someone explain how we arent being misled into looking at hedge funds and brokerages to keep the spotlight off the dtcc i believe citadel and melvin didnt in any way directly make robinhood and others halt gme buying they didnt have to the dtcc clearinghouse is owned and directed by its users literally a consortium of banks and brokers including two of mr griffins citadel firms check the alphabetical list know there are practical reasons it was set up that way but theyve clearly shaped and manipulated it so it can save their asses its a complete scam that the dtcc is apparently allowed to manipulate order flow the way they have without any impartiality or accountability to the public its why these hearings are and will be a sham that we wont get anything out of other than a few memes because congress and investigators know theyll never find a smoking gun by investigating the hfs and brokerages
102,60,2021-02-19 05:14:01,it wasnt about the money for me gme i consider myself a wsb semivet i was here before the corona virus hit the us during the corona virus i remember watching daily trump task force meetings and being bear af on spy with my puts however im here to let everyone know who lost money and is still holding if you can afford to lose the money this small movement shows that we are tired of being pushed around this movement shows that when we want fucking change we can push for change this movement was hard there was a lot going on and we were going up against a lot of money with broken rules in a fraudulent system this has sent waves to other groups for example i am a medical student who is pursing a do degree which has been declared on par with an md look it up if you want to get into the weeds but we take the same classes and standardized tests to practice along side mds anyways recently due to corona one of the exam step ii cs was cancelled for mds only the dos still had to pay for this exam fly to the location and take it the subreddit rmedicalschool fought to call out the aacomas the group responsible for dos with everyone at the medical subreddit seeing what you guys did here caused them to push and get the test cancelled recently i put 10k and have lost 8k but this is a lesson for me that and a middle finger to the rest of our country that we are tired of being pushed around by boomers who are getting comfortable in their high up positions if you are a boomer that is taking advantage of younger generations so that your lazy ass doesnt have to do jack shit we are coming for you we want blood tldr we might not have won but this sub has inspired other groups of people to fight the own goliaths in their lives and they are winning those battles im holding gme to remind myself what a bunch of retards online can do
3100,408,2021-02-19 04:53:40,if melvin capital exited all their gme positions whos still holding the 350 million uncovered shares hey fellow degenerates ive been seeing some reports that 100s of millions of gme havent been covered yet the melvin capital guy just under oath stated that prior to buying restrictions placed on gme by brokers they had exited all their positions however i wasnt convinced with that because the price kept going up for a bit someone correct me if im wrong please while seeing a lot of positive dd about this whole situation is good you have to admit that its a little worrying when theres not even a bear dd on this case ive seen some due diligence on here and as good as been good and reassuring to read im someone who likes to be realistic with everything including whats happening with gme i would like to do my own due diligence and find out whats happening through my own research and have decided to start here by getting the perspective of those who have done their own dd ps question to those who are up to date with the gme numbers say if its true that melvin exited all their positions can it be argued that these $350 million of uncovered worth of shares were placed when gme hit $450 highs and that these positions will then be covered when shorts have driven the share price to a low price this would make sense because buying of gme was restricted if true that would mean those who are still holding are just bag holders right edit meant to say $350 million worth of shares on 350 million shares

1447,204,2021-02-20 05:34:49,vlads testimony about the 511am phone call vlad tenev testified to the members of congress at the hearing that he received the phone call at 511am i think the lawmakers or most others havent realised vlad is in australia it sounds innocent as it was 5am time that the shares hit 570 in the early early hours of premarket on the morning of 28th of january sydney nsw australia is 16 hours ahead of new york so if it was 511am he got the call that puts it maybe midday on the 27th of january in new york time 17 hours before the premarket height of 570 came on the 28th of january us eastern timezone after which minutes later he pulled the plug same time as this phone call he did a video interview on cnbc saying retail investing is the new home ownership at this time i dont know if he already had received the call or after becky on cnbc thanked him at the end of that interview for being awake so late in the nightearly in the morning and referenced he was in australia and vlad acknowledged what time it was exactly but what is definite everyone that bought shares after midday on the 27th of january and for the following 17 hours vlad knew those investors were screwed because of that 511am call on australian time ______________________________________________________________________________________ edit maybe someone can find what time exactly vlad made that live interview on the cnbc show on the 27th to figure out if he had already gotten the 511am call i know that in the 27th of january live gme thread here on wsb when vlads interview started some posters mentioned it in the comments wsb autists get to work finding the exact time his interview commenced on cnbc the gme thread for january 27 2020 the gme thread part 2 for january 27 2021 the gme thread part 21 for january 27 2021 the gme thread part 314 for january 27 2021 bonus tendies if someone can figure out what gme was trading at that time of the interview 511am phone call on the 27th 27th of jan opened at 35483 high of 38000 low of 24900 closed at 34751 technically vlad did get the 511am call on the 28th quite smart deception going on i have to admit any further questioning of him needs to be specified et time and date and not his australian timezone
16,5,2021-02-20 05:05:22,the biowar focus on bcrx showed where it would go its kinda funny how a quick move no matter what the cause tends to reach only where a stonk is headed anyway the shot the shorts pushed bcrx up to 13 only to quickly fall back since touching where the stock was prebiowar the shares are quickly running right back up toward 13 i hope many of you were successful trading all that action but the writing is on the wall for this one anyway this shit is headed way up from here i wonder if the same will happen for gme and the rest over time

131,51,2021-02-20 04:22:27,the real reason why rh is hated when we first learned about rh restricting trading on gme we all saw through any generic pr marketing statements and felt as if we knew exactly what was going on rh was trying to cover their buddies at melvin and citadel and let them catch up to their shorts however even though i still believe rhs close partnership with citadel did have an influence on their decision to outright ban buying of the stock but not selling we do need to focus on the real problem here which isnt necessarily robinhood x200b vlads first interview was on cnbc on the day of the restrictions link in comments vlad went on cnbc and originally claimed that the decision to limit buying on the securities was a difficult decision and it was to protect the firm and protect our customers x200b later vlad came on cnn to again reaffirm that the problems at robinhood were not liquidity issues link in comments x200b from further statements and his congressional testimony we now know more about the details about what happened on the 28th vlad received a phone call from the dtcc at 4 am asking him to raise the collateral necessary from robinhood by tenfold a number of about $3000000000 total understandably so a company like robinhood which according to estimates is only worth about $10 billion itself does not have $3 billion lying around to post as collateral this although almost a textbook definition of a liquidity problem is denied to be a liquidity problem by vlad i believe vlad specifically uses the phrase robinhood does not have a liquidity problem because he was eventually able to raise the capital necessary to continue operations within the next few days albeit at the expense of the consumer whose longs were already able to be covered by shorts in that time period x200b if vlad actually gave any sort of shit about the everyday investor he would be using his platform to criticize the dtcc requirements especially after such short notice a 4am phone call when the stock spiked the dtcc raising collateral requirements by tenfold during the entire saga is unprecedented and frankly ridiculous considering how much money the dtcc processes on a weekly basis x200b tldr vlad tenev is a puppet and cant act on behalf of his client base to criticize the parties that should actually be held responsible for what happened on the 28th so any backlash robinhood gets is still well deserved we need answers on how the dtcc can arbitrarily increase collateral requirements by tenfold within the timespan of less than 24 hours
768,141,2021-02-24 13:54:44,the 128 gme smoking gun in the room so portnoy just took vlad to townhere if you havent watched vlad essentially admits to market manipulation when he says we should listen to how thomas peterffy explains it watch the lead in around the 2625 mark in portnoy interview above if you listen to thomas petterffys interview it is a must watch search you tube for cnbc interactive brokers thomas peterffy on gamestop hearing he said that gme would have gone to $1000 and that would cause a cascading effect across the market breaking down the financial system full admission that the price would have gone up so they purposely manipulated the market to keep gme from reaching $1000 and going exponential from there im shocked vlad brought this up the way he didthis is a straight up market manipulation smoking gun and cost retail traders billions

12,38,2021-02-23 05:23:53,thoughts on alibaba i apologize to the retards that are triggered by this not being a gme post what are everyones thoughts on baba and their current valuation most of us will probably say yes it is extremely undervalued but then the question is when will the valuation start to catch up to previous highs or even surpass them i understand no one can know for sure just looking for some thoughts one thing i do know is there has been some unusual bullish options activity thousands of calls purchased at $300 319 and $280 226 my current position is $280 calls exp 319 i have been holding for quite some time and im a little nervous after friday and today expiration is getting too close to see these kinds of dips so again just want to start a discussion if possible

206,122,2021-02-22 13:36:42,theory on recent gme options activity i am not a financial advisor i am definitely not your financial advisor i can barely be considered a functional adult if you base your actions off of anything other than your own research youre an idiot so i wanted to chat about gme option activity and open some discussion around it someone else might have already opened a thread but if so i missed it been working all week and this weekend im so fucking tired there has been chatter about a high volume of weird $1 and $050 puts but i hadnt really considered it important however i started to see what seems to be a pattern theory someone is using put options to engineer a reverse gamma squeeze my theory is based on option open interest information from yahoo finance when looking at the main upcoming expiration dates 319 416 716 all quantities listed are approximate in total from $0 $50 strike there are 700k put options representing 70m shares from $0 $100 there are only 714k call options of the 700k put options 471k of them are at or under a $10 strike in fact over 215k are at or under a $1 strike the rest are spread out pretty evenly across the range from $50 strike and down i have to ask myself what type of smooth brained idiot maybe someone here would think they could make money off of a $050 or a $1 strike put after thinking and looking at the other activity i started to wonder what if the plan is not to make money on those puts but utilize them to help drive the price down and make money off other puts lets assume the average $05$1 put was $0015 in premium the 215k options would have cost $3225k with only $3225k 215m shares are represented and im assuming the mm would need to sell shares short to hedge right the rest of the put activity looks spread out and seems to encourage a fairly consistent downward pressure on the stock when combining the three expiration dates put options are 23k$50 27k$40 23k$30 21k$25 45k$20 24k$15 75k$10 396k from $9$05 especially with the current relatively low daily volume any drop in price influences the mm to hedge which further reduces the price which causes further hedging feedback loop with 70m shares represented and low trading volume i would think the influence would not be small if the theory is true im not sure what to do to make money off it besides standing by with cash to buy as the price drops thoughts position 800 shares $50 dca sold some ccs with $60 strike showerthought rwallstreetbets would be a great place to recruit marines it is well known that crayons are a major portion of a marines diet a high proportion of marines wives have boyfriends what is a marine if not smooth brained much 3 to my marine brothers and sisters d
134,47,2021-02-22 02:54:28,tiered entrances investing in bubbles safe practices discussion allow me to vet myself quick im a dumbass and this is not financial advice be your own boss and do whatever the fuck you want so weve all seen the posts of people sinking their 401ks into gme at $300 obviously any financial advisor would tell you this is stupid it seems like it wouldve paid off without rhs fuckery but hypotheticals dont mean jack shit when were in the situation we are lets propose some anyways so how do you safely enter a volatile market when youve been outoftheloop well my strategy is simply to inverse the idea of tiered exits into tiered entry points lets take gamestop since i assume most people are aware of the situation with its price 2 weeks ago gme was valued at $60 a week later it hit $50 and even made a sprint down to $40 somebody outoftheloop has 1k in liquid capital is looking to invest in gamestop theyre itching to get a ticket to the rocket ship they can buy 3 shares at $300 and wait if theyd like but what if they only bought one share at $300 if the price rockets great they made a quick buck of their initial invest but what if it tanks we know the shorts still have to cover but the price tanking is too juicy of an opportunity to pass up if the price hits $60 this person may look at the situation and go i want 5 more shares at this price well now that person owns 6$100 and has $400 in capital to throw around this person then decides to wait until friday before close next week to see where things are before options expire the price hits $40 and they scoop up 10 more shares with the remainder of their earmarked capital they now have 16$625 the results for simplicity lets assume this person wishes to exit their positions at 1k the payoff scales with the price so the exact exit price doesnt matter yet scenario 1 this person invest $900 for 3 shares the price skyrockets and they exit with $2100 doubling their initial investment with a substantial amount of risk involved scenario 2 the stock takes off but our investor has decided to hold onto their capital the price goes to 1k they cash out and are at $1700 net not that far off scenario 1 but much lower risk scenario 3 present circumstances heres the dream scenario for the patient investor the price skyrockets to 1k and they liquidate at the peak their $1000 turns into $16000 they patiently await the price decreasing so that they can reinvest doing so slowly and in a tiered fashion again on the way down to repeat the strategy they dont truly know where the floor will be but they want more gme and are willing to take some minor losses to ensure they can get in on the true floor scenario 4 fuck so what happens if things go tits up well the hasty investor lost $900 and cant buy back in when the price tanks they have $100 and change left over the patient investor lost $300 but can average down for pennies on the dollar if they still believe the company can pull back if they followed scenario 3 even selling at $20 nets them $320 the patient investor lost 13rd less than their impatient brethren but at $60 entry they can simply wait out their position for a year and see what ryan cohen does the impatient investor simply cannot do this their price of entry is too high and theyre out of liquid capital they have to invest far more in order to recover their initial investment lesson be patient dont throw all your capital around at once if youre outoftheloop fomo will destroy your potential gains and increase your risk be analytical and calculating plan for the unexpected and your profile will look a lot better the prices dont matter this is about trends replacing the above numbers with other numbers will result in the same trends appearing with differing degrees of profit tier your exits tier your entrances be patient and logical thank you for coming to my shed talk discussion is down below and the moon is up above

537,223,2021-02-21 11:44:03,anyone else notice chamath flipped sides on gme and robinhood i havent seen this discussed here if it has been let me know and i can delete this but i noticed chamath had vlad as a guest on his all in podcast about a week ago as a bestie guestie and everyone just threw him softballs and completely accepted that robinhood did nothing wrong whole thing felt like they were just giving vlad a platform for his pr fake apology tour then chamath went on bloomberg and completely reversed his position on the gme and robinhood walking back everything he said before apparently youtube links arent allowed but if you search chamath bloomberg it should be the first result posted a week ago bullshit starts at about 205 podcast you can look up wherever you listen to podcasts its the all in podcast episode 22 feb 12th second to most recent thoughts edit ok so i took the advice of some commenters here and listened to the latest episode good discussiondebrief at the beginning of the episode worth a listen if this topic interests you also it looks like for the most part you guys look at chamath with a healthy amount of skepticism which is good and what i think one should do with any billionaire or similar public figure

174,129,2021-02-21 09:30:57,a bug in schwab caused my retirement account to go naked short gme this is a story that involves gme but it is not about gme the events im describing here happened on january 28 in my cash retirement account in short i had some gme shares and used the interface to sell them immediately after i read that robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button a few minutes later it did not appear to work so i attempted to sell again subsequently my account showed that both sells went through then my account had the cash from both sales and a negative balance of shares that i was required to deliver in 3 days after seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing without limit i freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss $180k if i was lucky and the price went down i could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain and could have kept my mouth shut not that i would have but instead im out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug and schwab owes me about $180k had i not covered this erroneous short position the shorts probably would have become what we know to be failures to deliver i have attached the record of what happened below which i sent to schwab soon after the event to try to get the situation undone i eventually was able to call their support team and they said i would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation the guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug in other equities too i cant recall the complete conversation anyway i recently got a message in the system that i would have to wait another 30 days so i flipped my shit and now im posting about it here please dont comment about how retarded i am for investing my retirement in gme thats not the story i do what i want i like the stock and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded i am and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on i have no information about how many naked short positions were created other than it was more than just myself and in other equities as well i have no information about whether or not the bug still exists i did not test it it may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem as far as i know related i recently posted something that made me suspicious to rstocks i didnt realize this until today but i connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my schwab retirement account ie schwabtd are the same company and these two things could be related here is the message i sent to schwab for a record of what happened you might notice that its a 401k which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading but it is a selfmanaged fund and individual stocks are actually allowed start of message to whom it may concern my name is my account number is i attempted to call your 1800 number several times but i was unable to get through to your support here is a breakdown of what happened there is a bug in your system that caused my nonmargin account to briefly become short gme shares my account is a nonmargin 401k account in good faith i spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into two trades need to be undone at market open my position this morning was nnnn shares of gme at 1109 i attempted to place a market order to sell nnnn shares order aaaaaaaa the order did not show up for about 10 minutes my account balance still showed nnnn shares so i attempted to make a similar order again i placed a sell of limit or better to sell nnnn shares at $125 order bbbbbbbb about 10 minutes later i got confirmations for both orders and a notice that the account was due securities i do not have a margin account and it should not have gone short the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account once i realized what the system did i saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account i did a market buy at 1144am for nnnn shares using the buy to cover button which zeroed out my position in gme order cccccccc the erroneous trade needs to be undone and my buy to cover also needs to be undone as both of these are not legal trades for my 401k orders bbbbbbbb and cccccccc should not exist on my account bbbbbbbb is a result of a bug in your trading system and cccccccc was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem im sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened and i will refer to it when i call again when your call volume is reduced end of message disclosure my current positions in my 401k are as follows ignoring what schwab owes me gme 4500 shares cash money market $180k again please dont comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies none of this is advice if you do anything related to what im talking about here youre probably retarded
1082,147,2021-02-21 08:08:10,interplay of relationships between goldman sachs robinhood melvin gee em ee and dtcc tldr goldman sachs morgan stanley and jp morgan are melvins main prime brokers all three firms privately own and sit on the board of the dtcc if naked shorting occurred in gme theres good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the dtcc may have shut down 128 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary collateral requirements stated if youve read my last post i hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in gme prime brokers and the dtcc which is privately owned by the prime brokers would need to be complicit in it which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 128 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons on the question of whether dtcc was right to shut down trading on 128 based on collateral requirements im not an expert on this subject but ive seen many compelling arguments against it including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million per following dtccs special requirements and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin and why was selling allowed but not buying why not shut off both another interest point is that the dtcc has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the dtcc is privately owned by prime brokersbanks one question posed to me by a reporter was who are the prime brokers involved so i decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form which shows that goldman sachs morgan stanley and jp morgan are melvin capitals three largest prime brokers based on assets held under custodianship as a reminder if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred pushing prices to thousands per share the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call all three firms own and sit on the board of dtcc note that national financial services fidelity is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 116 billion each for goldman sach and morgan stanley and 265 million for jp morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot 032020 i found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board note the same goldman sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases source and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement also the same goldman that accidentally leaked its own emails while defending a naked shorting lawsuit that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting including quotes like we are not borrowing negatives i have made that clear from the beginning why would we want to borrow them we want to fail them and stock is trading at negative rebate with nonpaying customers naked short in one email goldman sachs tells a client we will let you fail ftid trade a stock without locating it and an email from a goldman sachs hedge fund client who remarked that when wanting to short an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it he would then be shocked to learn that goldmans representative could get it for us source another interesting datapoint is that goldman was chosen as the firm to take robinhood public so alongside with the robinhood citadel relationship as it relates to selling order flow and rh making making 40 of their total revenue from it theres also a relationship between robinhood and goldman sachs who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the ipo the thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 128 shut down which short squeeze was set to occur and when interactive brokers ceo projected price wouldve been in the thousands is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in gme because if it did then the prime brokers involved and dtcc would likely have been complicit they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting as long documented by counterfeitingstockcom the short hedge funds the prime brokers and the depository trust clearing corp dtccmake unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small american investor continues unabated the counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the dtc which is owned by the prime brokers a number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants including goldman sachs bear stearns citigroup merrill lynch ubs morgan stanley and others the dtcc has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the dtc and major clearinghouses potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized the attack is planned to its most minute detail the plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy source a former economist who worked in operations at the dtcc susanne trimbath even came out in this insightful article and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the dtcc i highly recommend you read the full article just to highlight one part of it timbath says the securities and exchange act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement it allows them to punish those who dont deliver by refusing to have them in the system the dtcc has for years ignored that source in laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in gamestop the nature of naked shorting means its not easy to prove and there have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that but if youre an investor in the trade youve probably noticed that in the past three weeks gme has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 21 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped these things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred in the case of gamestop there are several very strong signsindicators that naked shorting has occurred i will list some of the indicators that naked shorting occurred in gamestop below 1 one indicator is gmes extremely high number of fail to delivers which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time the website shows extraordinarily high ftids extending from 2020 to years back michael burry tweeted that in may 2020 when he lent out his gme it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares ftids can happen for a number of reasons but to have this high number of ftids over a sustained period of time is highly unusual and a stock with a high number of ftids is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured 2 short interest in gme has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100 of float as of january 15th short interest was 226 of the entire float while it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100 with brokers repeatedly leading to each other short interest this high at 226 of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short 3 institutions alone have held a staggering 177 of float as of 131 according to bloomberg terminal which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that gme is rampant with counterfeit shares another interesting datapoint is fidelitys calculation of retail ownership is only 01 float which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true another potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined on monday 21 there was a momentous price drop and that drop continued through the week given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze the price drop made little sense especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there shouldve been an upward price pressure what makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder described below short a will sell a counterfeit share at $10 short b will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position short b will then offer a short counterfeit share at $9 short a will hit that offer or short b will come down and hit short as $9 bid short a buys the share for $9 covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit by repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral if there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic failstodeliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand source in an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up as of 21 with gmes reported short interest declining with price also dropping there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover which is in regulation of regsho and again this assertion is supported by the high numbers of ftids gme has consistently reported

0,112,2021-02-25 20:08:42,can gamestop destabilize the entire market x200b gamestop volatility is picking up meme stock phenomenon is not going away success in gme could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system instant clearing will not occur quickly regulators will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault after a few weeks of normal 2030 intraday moves gamestop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterdays regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168 volatility is picking up the volume in after hours alone surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41m shares changing hands it is very possible that gme volume today could exceed 100m shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as aapl the fact that gmes volume could approach the volume of aapl a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd but gme is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis it is the preeminent meme stock which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the reddit rwallstreetbets bulletin board copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes the gme phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow while this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market weve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced robinhood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house robinhood has since shored up its balance sheet but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity especially if the gamestop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5x or 10x new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded financially dubious securities creating massive 200500 daily moves regulators will need to step in we have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that havent changed much in centuries it is absolutely clear that if meme trading is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions a task easier said than done the clearing of trades is a multitrillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 9999 uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow yesterdays fedwire wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions a much larger and more important business is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a brownout event much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply the events in texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold the very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation long term bans may be the only policy play at this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal cultural and technological directives to instantly move to realtime settlement the only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25 in a day absent any material financial information from the company the suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current versions that are in place regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the meme stock security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes the bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any otc trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows if a hobbyist robin hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50000 fine for illegally trading it the speculative fervor would cool anathema to free markets this is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases it is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision the current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets the ultimate irony of the gamestop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets 
159,25,2021-02-25 19:41:38,gme to the moon webbased game hey guys i actually shared this game 12 weeks ago but i got immediately banned after working on this for you guys just because i had a link that if you want you could support me with a pocket change but i cant wait the gme is going again so i removed the link on the bottom of the web page and sharing it with you guys again i hope you have fun original text i have been following wsb for 12 months just before all the hype began i of course also joined into gme train and made some gains in the early days but then got in again too high and didnt expect hedgies to play this dirty so i am still holding guess i have diamond hands anyways i thought why not make a small game for my fellow retards to have a bit of fun so here i present you i am always open to ideas and tweaks x200b 
241,66,2021-02-25 19:33:27,its only the pre squeeze tell your loved ones this is only the presqueeze get on before its too late gme is about to leave our galaxy 
322,188,2021-02-25 19:11:54,is it possible that wsb owns more than 50 of outstanding gme shares this might be autistic but if there are only 6975m outstanding shares of gme and 93m members of this sub wouldnt we own over 50 of the shares if each user owned only 4 shares each 493m 372m 6975m50 sure many of the members are bots and many are just watching from the sidelines but is an average of 4 shares per member really that much of a stretch seems totally possible to me whats stopping us from electing dfv to the gme board of directors could this also be possible
83,62,2021-02-25 18:04:55,possible explanation for gme one of the craziest things about gme is its beta which is 226 as of now no manager with multiple brain cells is long the bond market right now which is historically the overall stock market hedge what exists that isnt a leveraged product to provide that kind of correlation protection if we set aside the insanity of this stock at this price for a minute what if some big money looked at the data and decided that gme is a smart way to hedge their risk on a stock market at all time high where bonds are just slicing their way higher at an alarming rate losing money hand over fist add on to that they get to tighten their grip around their competitors balls squeeze them into folding make a profit plus get new clients at the same time honestly the more i think about it the more sense it makes tldr maybe gme is a little less crazy than it looks edit also possible that someone out there hates robinhood enough to put a gme sized hole through its business so large itll never recover
46930,5984,2021-02-25 17:25:32,if gamestop hits 800 before 226 we will trigger the mother of all short squeezes read up alright ya fucks im gonna get straight to the point if gamestop hits 800 before 226 we will trigger the mother of all short squeezes as we learned from the last spike to 483 it was not the shorts squeezing as melvin admitted in the congressional hearing that they did not cover and the spike was from gamma if you do not know this gamma squeeze occurs because of call options as the prices surges market makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available surging the price higher so now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40 we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go ready to be launched there are millions and millions and millions of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800 these shares are not only buried in the 226 calls but also every single date after this as well so many fucking shares if we can get to 800 and all these calls become in the money the market makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up the craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering so as the mother of all gamma squeezes squozes sending the price into the thousands the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices if you did not read my last dd here about gme short interest being 400 we learned that uthabat ran an aigenerated model of gmes stock price which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme $130k a share now while i then believed this to be a completely outlandish number i now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800 is what it predicted to reiterate i believe that the aimodel of gamestops share price which predicts $130k a share is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 226 therefore causing the mother of all gamma squeezes which will then trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k many others are also starting to realize this as well check out this post on rstocks while this is not financial advice it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before friday this ai believes we fucking did it lets prove the future right edit end of day 226 just so some of you idiots realize lol
53,86,2021-02-25 16:39:46,what if gme mooning and upcoming inflation concerns are related so ive been reading lots of dd posts lately maybe too much but i think people are wrong assuming that the stimulus will cause unexpected or out of control inflation but instead i think the unexpected transfer of wealth gme will cause if it does in fact moon could cause inflation problems the thing that has kept inflation under control was that it went to rich people who let the stock market soak that extra cash up but if the retail traders take that wealth out it could start circulating and end up overinflating the economy now clearly i havent actually researched this or it would have the dd flair its just something that ive been wondering about and if any autistics can help this retard understand why hes wrong 120 shares of $gme$120 avg
214,43,2021-02-25 15:53:34,this is not over we have not won yet remember what happened the last time we have cornered the bear but an animal in a corner with no way out is at its most dangerous hedgies are fucked like billions fucked if you think that they will roll over and die you are sadly misstaken they are wounded and hurt and their actions from here on will reflect that they will cheat they will fight dirty hell if all else fails they might even try flipping the board dragging the whole market down in a last spitefull attempt at payback a bear is conserning a wounded bear with no escape is terrifyingly dangerous in what specific way should we expect fuckery from melvin the bear edit positions gme 6 shares 330 4 shares 240 14 shares 41
114,109,2021-02-25 15:46:32,why gme 30 short interest isnt real hey guys this is my first post ive been trying to figure out how 140 short interest of gme can be covered so quickly all the way down to the current 30 short interest that is being reported online so i heard that if an institution has 100 shares sold short they can also buy one deep itm call to be neutral and report 0 short so instead the hedge funds most likely bought long calls to make it look like they had cover their positions problem is if they buy far out the premiums are really expensive so instead they probably bought short dated calls and when they expire they have to buy new ones otherwise the real short interest will be reported can anyone give me feedback on this because im a retard fuck the hfs and of course gme 
569,136,2021-02-25 15:04:12,hot $bb gamma squeeze dd first of all id like to say gme to the moon here is the deal like gme bb has been going down the drain every since the small squeeze after the nasdaq drop have become confident that this stock will plummet and didnt think it will moon with gme well now it has and it can fuck shit up this is a shit of calls about to expire green this friday we end over $13 tomorrow we trigger a massive gamma squeeze and this stock moons there are currently more than 18700 contracts open as of the end of the day grab some bb before takeoff because we are ending this week at $50 500 9
71,86,2021-02-25 14:42:44,bringing my cash for some gme calls need advice  hello fellow apes i missed the last ride of glory but wont be missing this i have $8k that i wanna throw in with you on this ride to moon but im a little confused about the call option any suggestions about a strike price date im 100 fine if i loose all $8k wife is already banging her bf in beside me in bed i was thinking $225 strike price for 226 but is that too low any thoughts on strike price and date would be super helpful i truly like the stonk and feel a new cfo will take gme places like the moon and beyond thanks 
1,0,2021-02-27 19:29:00,anyone got access to a bloomy terminal and willing to share current days to cover for gme short availability could have dropped due to risk tolerance and the buy side volume thats picked up of late you can only short what the market will let you do be interested to see as the last report i had was around 34 of all stock is shorted also whilst fintel has picked up on an increase of short sided trades as a percentage of all trades its not particularly excessive although 150 million shares were shorted on the 25th whether they are open or closed only bloomberg will know
225,74,2021-02-27 12:02:22,the actual cause of the second squeeze was hedgies prematurely shooting 1 million shorts over cohens ice cream onlyfans pics i as any good curious george wanted to see what sparked the second act of the squeeze and started to organize a timeline of events ive commented on the days shown feb 25th data is missing for some reason from the site and have come to a theory about how we were allowed a second go around i think the hedge funds prematurely shorted gme out of panic trying to solve the ice cream frog emoji riddle instead of actually managing and responding to gmes price rise x200b looking into what just started the second act i started with the information from iborrowdeskcom that provides 15 minute updates to available shares to short x200b for comparison first look at tuesday and notice what a typical day for gme looks like no real excitement some shorts are exchanged overall the price sticks around $42 to $45 figure 0 day before the excitement now lets examine the day that sparked it all wednesday the morning starts off with some price rising that is met with shorts around 11am and a few more around 1130am up to this point nothing really out of the ordinary price is slightly higher than theyhfs would like but it seems pretty steady until figure 1 what really got us going holy hell cohen tweets an ice cream cone timeline of wednesday 145pm cohen tweets the image with the frog emoji which signals to the illuminati that its go time and prices shoot skyward gme rises from $48 to an all time high of $49 215pm hfs are panicked seeing the soft serve on social media and the impending doom of the frogs raining from the heavens hfs fire off 1million shorts around $48 to $49 240pm the economy slowly starts to collapse gme price rises to $51 x200b but whats that cause for its only $51 weve seen heights almost 10x that true we have however at 240pm 1661 call contracts just became in the money with a strike price of $50 calls that started to get people worried x200b with this momentum and the premature emission of over half the available shorts the price takes off x200b now what they could have done if they werent too busy chasing cohens national treasure movie plot was use their available 17 million remaining shorts to rocket in a dip but they used a million of them at $49share except heres a curve ball the amount of volume we saw during those 15 minutes doesnt account for 1 million shares shorted so where were those other shares shorted if not on a reported venue that yahoo finance would show excellent question young sec intern you tell me regardless they were using them somewhere and while they were busy doing whateverwherever the price got going again so since i dont have thursday data lets just move onto the end of this week for friday it was a slugfest but while not finishing off above 200 we did achieve $100 what happened friday we got it too $100 and with the $100 mark held this now unlocks 14k in calls at the $100 strike price leading us into next week 14000 calls at $100 strike price all in all i have no idea what causedwhere the 1 million unavailable shares wentdid around 2pm on wednesday retailvolume didnt pick up until after 3pm really after 330pm and none of the posts i saw here really picked up until after 45pm that day using shorts a full hour before any real sentiment came in seems very strange and ive yet to see anything that really digs into whatwhere they went tinfoil hat theory the use of 1 million shorts suddenly used in 15 minutes tripped a competitors algo and started to get them to buy up more shares to drive up their losses on shorting x200b tldr cohens ice cream brings all the hedgies to the yard prematurely shoot almost all their short loads off at once before the price even got above $50 if the 1 million shorts had been used in the 15 minute winow in the market the price wednesday would have dipped at least some around 2pm but almost no evidence at the given timestamp 3459 total calls for gme shares for staying above $100
92,39,2021-02-27 05:41:04,gme the high risk high reward play these are conclusions made from my own dd and opinions not financial advice the gme squeeze if it squeezes will likely be drawn out for weeks and even more likely months any catalysts along the way could trigger a squeeze ie earnings call in march or if cohen takes the helm in all likelihood this will not be a repeat of any prior squeezes because there is simply too much information available on both sides for both retail and hfs even more so for hfs no way imo will hfs allow this situation to play out the exact same way as any previous squeezes just think about how stupid would that be to play the game the same way that previously led to their demise if you think hfs will be that predictable well i guess you belong here the past can be a good indicator which is why we are able to pinpoint the criteria necessary for a squeeze but the market is forward thinking and we need to think that way too its hard to see whats in front of us if were only looking behind ultimately the squeeze is a high riskhigh reward play which why its unlikely just like any high riskhigh reward play but its also exactly why we play whats interesting is that although it is a low probability play the reward has a slight edge on the risk in the sense that the potential payout is greater than the perceived risk if it dips just keep in mind that thats the price to play there are too many variables happening behind close doors for this to be a sure thing with the overall market sliding and no catalysts the price action will be extremely unpredictable please stop throwing out random price targets without backing your numbers im just as bias as any other ape but im tired of seeing people comment 200 eod 500 next week without any substance behind their claims you might as well be a schill if thats all youre contributing imo everyone should have their own pts and goals as to when to buy and when to sell an arbitrary number that everyone rallies behind is unhealthy and will lead to many bag holders the good news is i dont believe gme will hit 0 because there are enough forward thinkers that believe in the future of the company minus the squeeze and unlike a traditional casino here at wall street bets we wont take all of your money if you lose just most when you sit down at a roulette table and go all in on 7 only for it to hit double 0s youll lose everything plus the ante but here at wsb youll still have enough to buy your wifes boyfriends footlong sandwich tldr the squeeze is a high riskhigh reward play with a low probability just like any high risk high reward play the reward here has a slight edge on the risk making it attractive to high risk investors also stop postingcommenting random pts with absolutely nothing to back your claims
0,41,2021-02-26 04:27:26,game theory 101 why wsb will lose its tendies trying to squeeze stuff discussion  gamestop to $130000 see you in the kuiper belt alright listen up you damn dirty apes im going to walk you through why these attempted short squeezes are just a recipe to get your faces ripped off im going to use bold on the important stuff so youll read it before you see a banana or something shiny this monkey troop is an uncoordinated mess to channel henry kissinger who do i call if i want to speak to rwallstreetbets thats good for legal compliance but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams 1 the prisoners dilemma is a game theory classic there are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together if both prisoners snitch on each other theyll both go to jail for a medium amount of time if both prisoners keep quiet it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and theyll only go to jail for a little while if one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet the prisoner who didnt snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long long time this is the position the wsb diamond hands gang is in if none of you sell the stock moons if all of you sell the stock gets nuked if some apes sell and other apes dont the ones who sell make money and the ones who dont get caca shoved down their throats each monkey on wsb has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys hands 2 recursion let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that gme really is going to $1000 every monkey thinks that when gme hits $1k all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash smart monkeys will see the $1000 top coming theyll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999 but then theyll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing meaning gmes peak will really be at $999 so monkeys get a little smarter and enter a sell order at $998 but now gmes only going to peak at $998 so monkeys enter sell orders for $997 the same logic leads us to sell orders at $996 then $995 then $994 and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation the squeeze never gets squoze 3 why was volkswagen different youve heard breathless accounts of how the vw shorts called up porsche crying and begging for relief dont wait for melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal porsche bought up a huge chunk of vw stock porsche was the only prisoner it wasnt going to snitch on itself porsche didnt have a recursion problem porsche was an 800pound gorilla porsche didnt have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts tldr 80 10pound monkeys cant squeeze as hard as one 800pound gorilla disclaimer 4 modz just saying that wsb is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing not that wsb should coordinate more yes this is a repost because my previous versions had a sick youtube video embedded that automod hated
43,16,2021-02-26 04:23:22,gme seems to be a key indicator of the vix this month what are the implications fellow simians take a look at the image below gamestop and the vix have been tied together this last month why do you care recap on vix a high vix means there are significant market irregularities and we should expect volatility and large fluctuations in the sp500 market vix going down means investors are acting normally and we should expect regular sp500 growth the vix has been on a steady trend downwards since lockdowns began vix is played mostly by institutions not retail investors as it requires actual market knowledge to not lose money here typically the movement of a smallish cap stock such as gamestop is not going to have any effect on the vix wall street seems to really be showing their hand here i think they know that a gamestop moon rocket could slam the market has anyone else been looking at this correlation not investment advice i just take screenshots from google position 2 young gme shares i know its small but so are my nuts

22,15,2021-02-26 00:57:29,rant are any other financial services professionals fed up with compliance limiting their gains everyone is talking about the lack of oversight on some segments of the financial services industry but can we talk more about the overregulation of the little guy i am being driven insane by my employers asinine trade approval policies and i know i am not alone here throughout the whole gme saga i was and still am unable to get in on the action due to the fact that every trade i make has to be meticulously approved by compliance and then held for a predetermined amount of time if i do not adhere to these rules then i could literally lose my job to be honest i wasnt all that confident that the short squeeze strategy would ever work but i was fully willing to throw in a few thousand into gme in hopes that i would be sent to the moon i know that im not alone here either as many of my coworkers and peers expressed that theyd be in gme and similar trades if they were given full autonomy over their pas somebody please tell me why a pm at a top fund can go on the news and start pumping up their positions but half of the financial services industry cannot get involved in the securities that are being pumped up it is ridiculous obviously these policies are extremely necessary in some cases eg an rx analyst is aware of an impending bankruptcy or an ma md just landed a role on a blockbuster merger but there has to be a better way for compliance to handle all of this for example why does somebody working in retail wealth management need to submit a formal trade approval request for five apple shares and then hold the shares for a set amount of time when they and compliance both know that this advisor in middleofnowhere ohio will likely never be in a position to have nonpublic information pertaining to apple in my current role i work with highprofile hedge funds like melvin nearly every single day and almost never do i come across any information that would benefit my pa and guess whatcompliance would have absolutely no idea if i ever did zero idea none they would just slowly approve my trade and move along to the next request the systems in place are largely for show and really only apply to a select few people everyone knows this insider trading ideas are generated on the golf course and at country clubs not places where complianceregulators can see you and making life difficult for fresh mba associates at a bank isnt going to secure the integrity of financial markets maybe regulators and compliance should actually be more targeted in their efforts to secure the integrity of markets maybe they could start by going after the institutional players that actually have the capacity to materially move prices imagine how much more retail capital might flow toward some of these trades if financial services professionals who are often highlypaid and passionate about markets were allowed andor felt free to get involved compliance if you are reading this please get a new system that actually makes sense and stop breathing down my neck if i want to throw money away into a trade that might blow up in my face then let me do so regulators if you are reading this please come up with regulations that actually monitor what matters and stop restricting the little guy for braindead reasons the façade is starting to fade and people are starting to notice that you arent working in their best interests positions who cares im only in etfs and a few alt mutual funds because of compliance

80,42,2021-02-26 06:59:33,rblx stock opening on march 10th its going to go to the moon count my words 1 revenue increased 87 in 2020 2 unlike recent stock openings there is nothing special with its opening will be easy to invest if nothing screws us over that is 3 the hedges are likely buying i know we hate them because of gme but they really dont care about us if we arent fucking them over dont expect to see another gme situation here will probably actually be beneficial for us from my observations i dont think physical school will impact their revenue too much theres already a lot of hype with rblx and we will have a stable source of tendies every december when all the kids are buying microtransactions revenue also increases in the summer with a small dip in august and a small increase in september theres actually evidence of the december bloom happening if you focus on the limited items on roblox all of them have a big increase in value in december if that translates to the stock using my huge calculator head i think the december bloom this year is occurring in march for the first time in 4 billion years gme may be going to the moon but rblx is the next rocket up there
2446,494,2021-02-26 06:46:33,why options will make the squeeze go parabolic at the the time of writing this it is 2am est february 25 im back with another gme post if you saw my past ones you probably already know what this is going to look like if you havent most of them were deleted when the mod stuff happened so oh well the purpose of this post is exploring options and the effect they will have on gme stock this will not be exploring lack of liquidity short interest or fundamentals i went through every call option chain and manually counted volume so all the numbers i use will be rough estimates and expect a margin of error to sum up the data there is 65k call options expiring this fridaythat likely will not be relevant unless we see massive price jumps today and early tomorrow there is 265 in all the other strikes put together this is 330k volume in total which is absolutely massive there is volume 65k concentrated in the 800 strikes 10k of this is for friday and the other 55k is all the other expirationsbear in mind i have not factored in puts volume as well which will have negative effects the two scenarios i will present rest on the fact that the squeeze reaches 850 and delta is roughly 100 making dealers need to hedge 100 once it reaches this point shit will start to heat up and price movements will be even more volatile scenario 1 cohen tweets a picture of a rocket ship price increases 4x in ah and trading tomorrow this would put price at about 800 dealers become fully hedged and need to have 330 1000 100 33000000 million shares by this point this is more than the entire float they likely already hold 10mil plus but in this event they would still need to buy more 23000000 shares scenario 2 it takes another week for price to rise to the 800 level all the options from last week expire this still leaves 265k means that 26500000 still need to be hedged this event is more likely and has a decent chance of happening has along as we get another catalyst what does this mean for smooth brained retards im sure the autist already see where this is going the simple version is if we reach 800 we will soar right past 1k and trading will become extremely violent price targets of 1k are laughable because if we reach 1k we are going right past it tldr we break 800 we going to alpha centaria pt 100k edit fixed numbers

107,10,2021-02-26 04:43:12,some dd on shorting cramers mustache so i was watching cnbc and saw cramer talking like he always does and staring at his mustache and then it came to me his mustache cannot last given how the total baldness of his head jim cramer is sixtysix which means he has definitely hit terminal length of his facial hair source and his mustache cannot last much longer in that moment i realized i am bearish on jim cramers facial hair we have watched the hedge funs short everything and it is time for us autists to strike back and short the very symbol of their power cramers moustache after this i started thinking about whether russian stonks could go to the moon and google russian moon rocket and the first thing that came up was a nose diving russian rocket x200b price target for cramers mustache i used that image and some really technical analysis that im very proud of as you can see the rocket intercepts the triangle forming a downward flag pattern consequently i have decided to pull all my positions except gme and to short cramers mustache always the way to 0 x200b this is not investing advice i just hate the mustache

68,43,2021-02-27 04:19:47,wsb 101 fuck me this took a while positions and tldr at the bottom welcome to wsb 101class code wsb42069 today we will be discussing current happenings in the market and how options trading works so youve heard about the gme volatility and you want in fine thats great welcome to the party but there are some very important things to keep in mind as youre learning how to trade with this crazy high volatility lesson 1 the market keep in mind as youre trading that volatility like this is not normal at least it wasnt before covid and it likely wont be after this can be a good or bad thing good if you can make some money bad because you can lose a lot more money in a much shorter period of time for a little more info heres a link to another post i made explaining market halts wait you say i want to make more money even faster these 10 rises in shares just isnt enough great yes there are other options available for you to do that but remember that comes with greater risk lesson 2 options so youve heard of options now have you okay thats fine but be careful options carry a lot of risk with them instead of losing 10 of your investment when your shares decrease 10 if you have a contract for a stock to hit a certain price the strike price by a certain point you could either make or lose multiple times the change of the stock movement so say you have a call contract you think the price will go up for lets say gme to hit $200 by march 5th that contract is worth roughly $125 share meaning it would cost $125 as each contract is multiplied by 100 shares now lets say on monday gme hits the price of $205 share congratulations your contract is itm in the money now you have 3 options you can sell the contract for that new premium price which is likely massive and youre looking at likely over 3000 gains on your investment you can hold the contract and hope it goes up more before friday or you can now exercise the contract meaning if you have the funds you can buy 100 shares of gme at your $200 strike price despite the current price being $205 okay now lets say you buy the same contract but the price falls from the current price of $100 down to $60 instead of losing the 40 from the stock going down youre now looking at a loss of probably nearing 80 or 90 with very little chance of it going up to $200 in the remaining time you have left for your contract this is where you have a couple options you can sell and take your losses you can sell and roll your contracts out to a further expiration date or you can hold that contract on the off chance you could make some of that money back by expiration though by then you could have lost 100 of your investment now here are some general guidelines when trading options 1 take your gains especially if youre looking at 1000 gains this rarely happens and is quite an impressive return you never lose when you take profits if youre experienced and know the price could go up even more make your own choice with what risk is acceptable to you 2 stay away from fds weekly options contracts the greeks on these are just too high for any new folks to make decent money on theta decay is not your friend 3 roll your contracts out a few weeks and look at leaps as a potential play as well leaps allow you to hold a contract for up to a couple years giving you ample time to make some money or recover losses from a dip 4 do your own dd due diligence you will read a lot of shit on this sub before you make a choice on what to buy do your own research 5 the real dd is always in the comments think of dd as someone trying to sell you something often times the folks in the comments have nothing to gain from telling the truth so youll read different perspectives in the comments about a stock i know this is a lot to read but its important especially for all you new folks but heres a tldr for all you smooth brains tldr dont trade weeklies unless you know what youre doing dont fomo your portfolio when youre worried about being left out of a run up and take your profits to reinvest or simply to have positions 35 gme $80c 50 shares at $47 some tesla and spy calls

56,14,2021-02-26 20:45:04,do your own thing but dont forget where you came from gme is special something this good isnt going to happen very often but it will happen again sometime a little calculus or watching an interview with someone like drukenmiller will inform you that it only takes a certain number of people getting out to move the market enough to the sell side thus removing the needed support under a price im not saying it will be a collapse of course only that the collective buying continued holding any tightly held stock enjoys being expensive to buy and the special stuff a group of inspired people coming together creates is what will guarantee gme at or above $300 what i am saying is that looking for what will be the next great thing will not find another gme for now things like this tend to happen once and quite spectacularly but almost never come in twos or threes ymmv and theres more money to be made as a retard disclaimer im just saying i bought 1 gme share yesterday and lost 30 between the open and close and figured as much im now happy to be a part of this i have for a while and continue only holding some amount of gold for now my contention is if youre long enough gme you will in that time probably watch the company do an offering of as little as 50m ordinary shares for up to $2b equity or perhaps raise enough cash on the back of a fuckton of the kind of advertising you cant buy like what elon did at tesla with enough cash to execute the ecommerce strategy and transition to online you might find that gamestop was in fact a $200 or $300 company this would be the true story of the company my point is that you might do just as well to keep doing the same thing and holding the line this is not any kind of advice of course just someones perspective people should make up their own mind note this is a repost from back when we were above $300 idk why it was deleted

27,37,2021-02-26 09:17:26,you might not know your abcs but do you know your gme possible exit strategies for the next squeeze alright gamers im a relatively new trader and have been dabbling for the past year earlier this month i decided to finally research the ins and outs of technical analysis and spent my entire day researching only technical analysis strategies after hours and hours of research and adderall i discover that technical analysis is basically astrology for stocks great researching more i tend to agree with this sentiment during my research i found this site which might have a terrible home page ui but you could spend weeks reading tons of great info with countless rabbit holes of links to follow highly recommend if actually want to learn something that said no one knows what the fuck is going on behind the scenes with gme right now if youre only in gme for the quick fundamental analysis is 90 out the window short interest percent float synthetic longs shove it all up your hairy ape ass if youre a retail trader you will always be at a disadvantage to the big boys especially during extreme short term volatility it would play a much bigger factor if we had access to the same data as the big boys at the same time but we dont unless your wifes boyfriend has a terminal so i started looking at last months chart to figure out if gamestop ceo george sherman was an aries or a pisces low and behold i almost shit myself ape things with how accurate this was actually though i was trying to find an exit strategy for maximum gainz if it moons again findings start here if you have squirrels attention span pennant pattern from 127 128 see chart confirmed volume trending downward percentage of pennant patterns meeting price target for updown breakouts 3532 to get a target price add the start of the price swing a to the end of the price swing b and then multiply it by percentage meeting price target 035 for an upward breakout add this to the bottom of the pennant c to get the price target source $145965 a $380 b $500795 035 175278 175278 290 c price target of $47409 imgur link what was the actual peak $483 now normally i would say technical analysis is trash but i think we all know the situation were in right now is far from normal and if you would have done this same analysis for the last squeeze you could have cashed out within 10$ of the actual peak thats a near perfect exit i audibly said holy shit when i saw that number what does this mean for the next squeeze no fucking clue but nobody knows whats going to happen and our only gauge for this scenario isnt vw in 2008 but precisely what happened last month i did see a head and shoulders with a price close below the neckline today though this is a bit more arbitrary than the pennant pattern with a bad volume match that said where price closes below the neckline a breakout occurs and it also confirms the chart pattern as being a valid headandshoulders top source either way with this pattern and especially with weekly and monthly calls expiring tomorrow im expecting another big rise but beyond that well have to wait and see since i have to exit eventually my strategy will be partially limit sells to keep initial investment and partially trailing stops or an all at once market order if a reliable pattern and target price emerge but who knows when that will be been holding since before the first squeeze thanks for coming to my retard talk
4504,547,2021-02-26 09:12:47,expectations for tomorrow okay so we went from $45 to $18468 and closed at $10873 so why the hell are there people complaining that is great news and to top it off short sellers lost $19 billion dollars just from these past two days fucking wow source so stop complaining were not even close to being done gme was down to $45 yesterday today is a win and so will tomorrow expect the worse but be prepared to land on the fucking moon oh heres some rockets for you retards 
164,42,2021-02-26 09:03:34,some short gme dd quick dd as you all know there was a relatively large spike yesterday now im no expert but i know that shorts have to cover which they did atleast a small fraction the older shorts theyve been paying interest over are bleeding them dry now was the spike the 24th coincidence a quick answer is simply no as you can see here or here the short disseminationreceipt exchange date was the 24th yesterday however there are no actual rules about them having to cover as long as they are paying interest pretty much the entire market except gme was red which means theyve been pulling assets in order to pay interest question is how long can the hedges keep this up untill they bleed dry there will be alot of fuckery and shenanigans untill they do i do know that there will be another huge spike around the 9th of march and with a few whales and good news might be the catalyst we need we are in the middle of a war which is far from over stocks go up or down but always sideways this might take weeks months or days anyways as long as you beautiful smooth brained bastards keep holding we will win they dont understand just how stupid we are and we are really fucking stupid anyways thats just my two cents and remember rockets only go up disclaimer i am not an financial advisor trade at your own risk

0,13,2021-03-02 00:16:52,how gme ss can be ended from my point of view gme ss event can not be ended in secondary market as the transaction cost is too too too huge that for short sellers to cover their short sell over 100 of issued share amount in the other word this ss can only be ended in primary market that means the action of gme broad of director allow issue new shares in like 120 of original amount of existing shares short seller is absolutely better to pay a premium price let say 400usd per shares for obtaining share to cover their short position rather than purchase it from secondary market disregard the price and hence attracting further purchasing power for speculation purpose if this assumption is possible let say issue new shares at 400usd in 120 of existing amount of shares then gme company would get 28billiln usd cash at once and hence the cash value per share will be around 200usd per share in an very raughly calculations this is the win win equilibrium for both short sellers and gme company short seller is able to avoid ss for unlimited loss and gme company is able to get enough cash for any beneficial restructure actions and for all diamond hand we still can make a nice profit on it even you are the buyer on historical high 500 usd you still able to recover 200usd per share and hence got a company with bright future as the result never loose you position in the price lets then 200usd thats all i can conclud at this moment in addition this is just the win win situation based on game theory once this equilibrium cant be reach ss in secondary market is still possible short seller may even pay much more premium to cover their positions i guess the ladder attack in last month to reducing the market price of gme is just for reducing the short sell interest payment and hence buy time for the negioation with gme broad of directors for this win win end game move so never sell your shares before you got it 200usd per share thats all for my sharing thanks for reading my poor english 
6,9,2021-03-01 23:30:28,possible reason why ssr wont make a difference today i have been watching premarket hours for a while because its fascinating and im trying to learn as much as possible about how stocks work ive been noticing something that was unexplainable to me at first high volume spike no price change taking a look at the premarket above there are spikes just like this that show a massive difference in volume but the share price goes almost nowhere ive already seen it this morning with another 200k spike in a single minute this happens every morning premarket usually 2 or 3 times with a volume ranging from 100k to as much as a million shares from what ive seen premarket blip of almost 600k shares on friday with no net change in stock price for this to be done by a single entity there are only two scenarios i can think of that would make sense 1 an entity is covering stock already owned with short positions they have this is off the books however so i would think it wouldnt even show in the volume premarket 2 an entity is short selling the stock and then buying as many shares as were sold short now why would someone do 2 pun intended lolunder ssr rules you cannot short a stock during trading hours unless the stock is on an uptick today gme is under ssr due to a 10 change from the open on friday during the day however you may be allowed to short during premarket hours at will im too smoothbrained to know if thats true but i cant explain that chart in any other way furthermore the number of available shorts on fidelity has gone down from 446000 to now 16804 in premarket now you would think shorting almost 450000 shares would impact the stock price premarket if done without a counterbalance now the hedge fund has gone short on a stock and purchased shares in the same amount since there is no restriction on selling a share the hedge fund is able to sell the share at will to have the same level of affect on the market as a short sale would id love to hear any other suggestions or ideas on what else could be happening but this is the only conclusion ive ben able to come to so far edit tldr hedge funds may be shorting shares pre market and buying just as many shares allowing the same impact a short sale would have throughout the day by selling the shares unrestricted 
76,28,2021-03-01 22:46:25,workaround for setting moonshot sell limits with your broker so theres been a few popular posts about boomer brokers limiting how high you can set the sell limit for gme shares despite the fact that other tickers are seemingly left to yolo at 50x100x1000x sell limit prices for context here is a test i ran the other day testing gme at 50x then 20x then 10x and finally 3x vs a growth stock which clearly did not satisfy the same requirementexcuse tdameritrade gave for not allowing a high gme limit cancelled you are trying to set a limit at a price which this stock has not traded at lately as you can see gme was denied at what was at the time 3x the growth stock however they had no problem with at a 15x multiple a price which it has previously never come remotely close to now the workaround i use tdameritrade i cant confirm that doing this also stops your broker from borrowing your shares to lend out but right now its the best alternative i have found this will likely be at least slightly different depending on which brokerage you use for tdameritrade you sign in hover over trade tab click conditionals for condition select contingent order trade trigger from there the first section the contingency would be filled out like this the second section the action would be filled out like this set as gtc ext and it will have that contingency order locked and loaded for however long into the future you set it to expire hopefully this works across all brokers this is not financial advice i just like the stock and think a $69420 sell limit is nice edit forgot these 
79,17,2021-03-01 21:21:06,market cap explained for new apes theres been a bit of fud thrown around saying that gme wont hit 100k because the market cap will be too big etc so heres a really simple explanation as to what market cap actually is and what it is used for market cap is the last traded price multiplied by the amount of shares in existence so if a company issues 1 million shares and the share price trades at $10 the market cap is $10 million this does not mean that the company is worth $10 million nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested in the company all market cap is useful for is to rank companies against each other another way to look at it i could create my own cryptocurrency and issue 1 million units i then sell 1 unit to my wifes boyfriend for $10 and all of a sudden the market cap is $10 million only $10 has traded hands yet it has a gigantic market cap so i hope you can all see now that market cap means nothing really its only use is to compare and rank it has no impact on our ability to hit $100k and beyond

310,86,2021-03-01 17:02:45,gme comparing volume options equity and closing price for the past 4 months apes i am seeing a lot of postsvideos in regards to predicting the date of the squeeze as much as i enjoy solid dd as the next guy i must draw the line somewhere and provide a healthy dose of skepticism first off fuck most of these youtube clout chasers who are doing nothing but spreading false hope and bad information cucks like that data scientist meet kevin and the rest dont know jack shit unless they show a sizeable position in gme their words hold zero weight dfv backed up his words with actions credibility should be earned not given i pulled some data from the following sources below 1 options volume source 2 daily volume closing price it appears to me theres a common sentiment that the week with the highest options volume is the week of the squeeze see the chart i created below what this chart tells us is that the second to last week of jan had the highest options volume it was the subsequent week where the real squeeze shouldve occurred if not for rhsecdtcccitadeletc i understand the etf rebalancing for xrt also occurs mar19 joined with the heavy options volume could potentially be all thats needed to start the squeeze however it is still my belief that the squeeze will occur once the shorts have hit their regulatory leverage limit and sec rule 204 comes into play the options volume is one factor but i dont think it should be the main or determining one i wouldnt put too much weight on this variable please feel free to disagree and provide logical rebuttals in the comments for anyone that doubts my credibility feel free to dig through my past posts i still have a large position in gme and will hold until the end of time tldr 1 if you truly subscribe to the notion that you can predict a date for the squeeze put your money where your mouth is and post some yolo 319 gme calls 2 options volume shouldnt be the main variable in predicting the squeeze in my opinion

1455,223,2021-03-01 10:10:39,while the gme rocket is preparing for launch hedge funds are likely shorting other stocks and placing calls on gme weve already seen how badly the markets did as gme suddenly did incredibly well last week hedge funds and shorters of gme had to liquidate other investments in order to do their aggressive short ladder attacks on gme yet with all the action around gme and with the current state of the world if gme does moon many other stocks will come crashing down as shorters are forced to cover their positions and this is how hedge funds will win no matter what happens theyve already set up gme to take off with how much aggressive shorting has been happening when the gme rocket takes off theyll hold shorts on other stocks while holding calls on gme and make huge money off all market activity and while gme moons retail traders and other hedge fundsinvestors that got on the gme rocket will win big time yet at the same time many of the rest of the stocks will crash and cause many to lose big time i wouldnt be surprised if enough insider trading is happening to have a planned date for when gme will take off so that they can time the markets perfectly and make sure as few retail traders are on the rocket as possible tldr its just like the movie 2012 but hedge funds will benefit whether the world ends or not
330,146,2021-03-01 10:08:28,a quick reasonable and logic explanation on what is currently happening to gme hi guys all the following informations are out of uncle bruce latest youtube video i cant post a link in here as the automod directly deletes the post but just search for gamestop gme uncle bruce says i think i know whats going on if you are interested in the 17 minutes original video i got my informations from im just quickly recapping everything he says for those of you that are too lazy or retarded to watch the video tldr and theoretical outlook at the bottom fictional example hedgefund a shorted 1 million shares at 120$ which means he sold 1m shares at 120$ the price goes down to 100$ in order to close the short position he has to buy back the 1m shares and return them to his mm his profit is the difference between 120$ and 100$ times 1m 20m $ in theory this sounds pretty simple but buying back 1m shares in a tightly packed and balanced buyerssellers market causes a huge overhang in favor of the buyer side more buyers then sellers stonk goes up by the time you bought 400000 individual shares back the price has gone back up to 125$ because people notice there is a huge whale buying a lot of shares if you would keep on buying back all your shares until you reached your 1m shares to close your short position you have driven the price up to 135$ just an example your average price is somewhere around 125130 $ again just a guess dont nail me on this one the whole maneuver now costs you around 510m $ because your average buy back price is higher then your original short position you cant do that because your short position is so large that closing it would require you to buy so many shares that the stock goes above your short entry point which makes the deal nonsense what you do instead you go to the chicago option exchange and you get 20000 itm calls for example 60$ which expire tonight normally such amounts of calls arent exercised because most of the people dont exercise their shares because they dont have the money to do so but you are a massive hf you shit millions a month as those calls arent properly hedged because everyone is greedy and nobody thought that this memestock would actually rise again the option mm now has to deliver 2m shares to hf a they might have a quarter of those 2m but they still have to buy 15m back from the market hf a uses 1m shares to close his short position and with the other 1 m he goes long because he somehow knows that the option guys fucked up or because he knows that other shorters are doing the same hf b c d also get a a lot of calls to close their short positions at whatever price suddenly there are a lot of calls getting exercised many option mm have to buy back shares at the market hf a waits for the option mm to buy all the shares for their calls which drives up the price option mm then deliver the 2m shares hf a closes his short position and sells the other million of shares while price is going up to 170200 because other option mm are keeping the buying power coming they closed their short position and made additional bucks through their newly gained long position many people in here are assuming that most of the options get hedged but this doesnt seem to be the case otherwise there wouldnt be such a huge buying power of the last days there was a huge 240m share volume in two days there are big institutional players involved which are trying to buy million of shares or in other words naked call options that get exercised in large quantities there are several hundred thousand of options in between the 60100 price range as the stock went down throughout the last month there were dozens of million shares shorted at some point all those short positions have to be covered at some point in order to make profit out of them this big buying wave might just been a first wave of option makers trying to cover the call options that are used by hf to cover their short positions that were created throughout the whole month of february and in the end of january this buying frenzy from option makers caused other options to be in itm which were bought by hf just on the day of their expiry which allows them to close more previous short positions tldr for tldr as requested option makers fucked up through nakedbadly hedged calls that are now itm and used by hf to cover their profitable short positions tldr insanely high amounts of mostly naked or badly hedged call options are exercised because hfs are trying to close their short positions that are several million shares huge without driving up the price through creating a buyer overhang or in other words the hfs are handing over the bag to the chicago option makers which now have to deliver million of exercised call options at a huge price range that they never thought of actually being exercised in those quantities outlook as i understood bruce right this process isnt over yet many call options expired at the end of friday and if several ten thousand call options are naked or badly hedged then this would cause the options mm to buy even more shares as the price went up to 100$ there are a lot of call options itm now that werent previously in the money if the options mm didnt prepared correctly in advance then this thing could go to the outer rims of our galaxy there were so much shares shorted while the price came back down from its highs at the end of january but all those shares have to be returned on day and you can only return back those shares through calls because otherwise the price would go back up as i said the bags just got passed on if dozen of million of shares are shorted throughout a whole month where the price goes down to 40$ then all those short positions still have to be closed on paper those million big short positions made hundred millions of dollars but buying back dozens of million shares creates such a huge buyer overhang that someone has to pay the price for those millions of shares being shorted from my understanding if you buy a option then you are making a bet with someone else your counterpart is the option mms in chicago through buying a call at 60 dollars you are betting that the price of the stock is higher as 60 dollars at the expiry date if the price makes it up higher than 60$ you won and the option mm lost the bet and needs to pay for his losses through complex hedging they are reducing their losses and on a total sum they still make a lot of money because they act as a big institution and not as a individual that either looses or wins his bet if another big institution steps up and outplays you then you still have to pay those huge losses as this is part of the casino sometimes there is a person winning at the roulette table making 1m $ at night but several other thousand people lost 10m $ at the other table but what if 20 guys win 1m $ in one night you still have to pay them the losses of the chicago option exchange is our gains and profit because in the end we retail guys are just a small fish that is snacking off the still decent leftover tendies that were available through 2 big sharks fighting

1180,363,2021-03-01 01:07:16,gmes inverse correlation with the market so i have recently been doing a lot of research on recessions and its hard to deny that it looks like we might be sitting on the brink of one i recently watched a video by jake tran regarding the striking similarities between the great depression and today rock bottom interest rates on the rise the average debt of individual americans the number of retail investors involved in the market which also correlates with germanys hyper inflation in the ww12 era as suggested by michael burry and the fact that wealth inequality is at an all time high since the days right before the great depression it seems to me at least that we are looming over some treacherous waters how does that correlate with gme well as we have seen anytime there is an increase in gme there is a corresponding decrease in the rest of the market whether that be from hedge funds liquidating other stock to fight the gme war or the general fear of investors of the implications that come with gme it has now happened both with the january and february rises and is not a coincidence the markets fell by as much as 3 in a single day when gme was on the rise now there has been some talk of a gamma squeeze still in the making im not sure about it but some redditors are putting the date as march 19th or at least in the weeks surrounding march 19th how accurate is that idk you apes can go find the dd yourself but it certainly seems a distinct possibility if it does occur though and it squeezes into the thousands or even tens of thousands the resulting impact on the market will be tremendous and given the delicate situation the market is in could very well trigger a recession now what i find interesting is what happens in a recession theoretically pinpointed on march 19th whenever a countries economy gets slapped around it affects the global economy and a crash on this scale would certainly cause global issues historically whenever there has been recessions war always breaks out almost every time not necessarily in the us but across the other nations as well considering our recent forays into the middle east again i dont see us not getting dragged in i also believe the tense situations over in that china india pakistan area is a powder keg ready to let loose as well remember all those tik toks with the pakistani kids vowing to destroy india they hate each other so at this point given where we stand i almost think its more risky to not have a share of gme as a hedge against market collapse and if it all goes south and gme goes to pluto im taking the tendies and investing in 3 things the digital security that cannot be named precious metals and most importantly defense stocks the defense stocks will be at rock bottom prices and ill be ready to catch them with my tendies anyway im not a financial advisor i hardly know what im talking about in this discussion im just and ape with a box of crayolas if you have a wrinkly brain feel free to tell me where i went wrong tldr its too risky to not own gme taking the tendies upon market collapse and buying defense stonks
25,63,2021-02-28 23:58:16,insufficient nonevidence based gme dd after pouring through far more data than i really should be consuming on gme i came to a few conclusions ill present my hypothesis first and let you all tear it to shreds 1 there wont be a squeeze until hfs are appropriately repositioned from short to long and wont just recover but profit 2 all of the expensive machinations witnessed thus far such as naked shorting trade halts naked calls etc are only stalling for time allowing hfs to reposition 3 when the squeeze happens the narrative will be played in the press as retail beating wall street when the reality is more like hfs and mms illegally manipulated the market so they could blatantly steal money from issuing naked calls and then after that game went stale they allowed the squeeze to make them trillionaires 4 theres a chance the squeeze wont happen at all and the hfs will continue to circlejerk retail around bleeding us for money on naked calls and dangling the dream of the moon in front of us i didnt think it was possible to manipulate the price so effectively with no shares but hfs have educated me on their antics im evenly split on whether i actually think the squeeze will happen at this point or whether hfsmms citadelvin will profit sufficiently from selling naked calls to keep the game alive i dont have reliable data on how many calls shitadel is selling per day the best clarity i could get was this obscure figure saying that shitadel does more volume than the nyse without a bloomberg terminal i dont think i can find data more specific to gme calls sold daily my estimate and my suspicion is that shitadel is making at least enough money selling naked calls to finance melvin short selling activity and probably more than that any newbies on this sub who invested for social justice reasons please either buckle up or strongly reexamine your motivations for investing you can make tons of profit in the market and do great good with your earnings but dont fool yourself that youll stick it to any hf who has by now already hedged the other side of a bad bet if you stick with gme and win take your earnings and make the world a better place or buy a tesla its all the same to us really were here for the sweet tendies x200b pattern recognition is my superpower so its taken me a little time to observe the process and see how things panned out gme price didnt break out on wednesday because of anything related to fed liquidity it was allowed to peak in order to drive up interest and call prices this is the real play dont get played the secondary value in allowing gme to peak is that it creates a sense of fomo now in people who didnt sell even knowing this was a psychology play i was surprised at how fast my animal brain jumped in saying but wait oooh shiney profits do not underestimate how fast the paperhands fomo will kick in when we hit $400 again the hfs really have a handle on price manipulation which should be illegal af but here we are tldr calls have turned into pump and dump and the primary profit goes to shitadelvin if youre new to options trading definitely avoid

42,29,2021-02-28 11:15:31,still puzzled by the buy restriction especially the timing i have no direct evidence but there are coincidence and conflict so i would like to straight it out as a reference for the once in history event a little background first 1132021 1272021 gme price went from 20 to 350 1282021 robinhood implemented buy restriction on gme this restriction was fully removed on 25 friday 7 trading days but 9 days include weekend in between there were partial restriction that is almost the same as full restriction during that time period gme closed down on 128 but higher on 129 friday big drops for the next 4 days mon thur from 350 to 53 the next day they fully removed the buy restriction and the price went up to 63 thats friday x200b i was puzzled by the timing the up trend is still intact up to 129 the second day into restriction even though there was big drop the day before when the buy restriction was implemented if the restriction was removed then the up trend would most likely still in place even enhanced 1 several other platform had restriction on 128 but no more the next day please help to verify this why r still has the restriction 2 news reported that r raised 1b on 129 and another 24b on 21 monday when another big drop happened if there restriction was based on the capital requirement by dtcc would this 34b more than enough to fulfill that requirement1b as we now know why did they still keep that restriction earlier that week citadel provided 2b bailout to short seller melvin the down trend starting from 21 lasted 4 days until 24 thursday the big drop on 24 knocked gme from 91 to 53 at this point if it went down even more 35 level on the left side plateau it would likely bounce back hard from there the more the compress the more the explosion power the restriction was fully removed on 25 the next day friday it was perceived as a good news but people tend to be cautious during friday because of uncertainty of weekend this seems to be calculated well timed action to reduce big swing the price had relatively small bounce back which slowed the downward pressure but at the same time released the explosive power from the compression
2611,535,2021-02-28 10:53:32,charles schwab is hiding a giant ball of shit and wont come out and say what happened how big is the ball of shit schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts yes it is a fucked up disaster and yes im already talking to lawyers so please none of the lawyer up shit i know what im doing im just here to tell you the story this bug caused my 401k cash account to be out $180k see my sunday post last week if you want details forget about my account though look at the comments this was me posting randomly on rstocks and without prompting for it i got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them lets figure this out with some admittedly imprecise napkin math suppose schwab is 5 of total stock market volume us trading volume is maybe $1250t between nasdaq nyse suppose the bug affects 5 of trades on schwab this number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10 before it gets resolved schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses half the price movements because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits 1250000000000 005 005 01 05 $156m per day in what im referring to as a giant ball of shit important points 1 schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day is the bug fixed i have not seen any announcements about it its been over 30 days and i still havent gotten a clear response from schwab about my own personal issue 2 this has been a problem for months according to the comments read through the comments on my post in rstocks 3 schwab only has about $20b in total equity according to wikipedia 2018 4 i could have easily left gme naked short in my account i dont know what schwab would have done or how many accounts have gone naked short and stayed that way it still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in yet at best schwab lost some money at worst schwab is actually bankrupt i currently dont think its very likely that theyre bankrupt but i do believe the markets are mispricing their stock schwab if you dont want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is then come out and say exactly how big it is and tell us where the fix it money is coming from not client assets i hope stay tuned for some more traditional dd in the coming daysweeks relevant positions about $50k of puts doubled down since last post feel free to read my last schwab post before i doubled down tldr i hate the stock im buying puts and schwab give me my fucking money back
41,56,2021-02-28 08:49:37,using covered calls to buy volatile stocks like gee em ee at a steep discount  typically covered calls provide a laughable premium while capping your potential gains lets use amd as an example as it looked friday at close going by the book for covered calls i selected an option with an expiration date just over 28 days away with a delta close to 040 this is an 8750c that expires 26 march 2021 amd closed at $8451 when the mid price for this option was $307 purchasing 100 shares of amd for $8451 and selling this option for $307 costs us $8144 and caps our max gains at $606 or 74 you might as well put your money in a cd or buy a treasury bond amiright now lets run the numbers for gme $10174 using an option with the same expiration and similar delta this is a 280c which had a mid price of $2003 at close purchasing 100 shares of gme for $10174 and selling the 280c for $2003 costs us $8171 and caps our max profit at $19829 or 2427 heres a table for some reason x200b options quotes can be found here whats the downside 1 $198k is not the moon 2 $8171 is a high entry point vs buying fds 3 paper handing the shares before the call expires is risky unless you buyclose the call whats the upside 1 this creates upward buying pressure with less money 2 you paid $8171 for $10174 worth of shares 3 dividends pay out 15 march additional considerations 1 gamestops earnings report is projected to release on 1 april but could release as early as 25 march 2 a squeeze could happen and the price could dip before your call is exercised 3 i have no idea what im doing and im not recommending this as a strategy none of this is financial advice i just started trading stocks this week and dont understand why the colorful lines arent moving on my screen today edit fixed link to find options quotes edit 2 fixed table also please keep roasting this idea thats how we all learn

4471,935,2021-02-28 03:35:00,shorts are literally running out of bullets hi fellow retards my hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in jan to short gme and temper the price back down now it appears that theyve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation as a parallel consider it from a mortgage perspective theyre trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now theyre selling off their valuable possessions so they cant borrow off margin they are out of cash and now theyre selling off their source of income which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their etf stocks but the hedges dont give a shit they just want to short gme no matter the cost the mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis i used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit you could qualify for a mortgage back then with a dti debt to income ratio of 65 for those unaware dti is the ratio of your gross income vs the piti of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report it does not factor in payments for utilities food gas so they assume people can afford a house with the 35 of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid no now the opposite is happening again they deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight eventually theyll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price they fucking deserve it from their ashes i hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal if i want to pay x dollars for a stock thats my business shorting is bullshit think a company is overvalued then close your position and find another fucking stock the government should be appalled trying to bk a company not only puts thousands out of a job but reduces the income tax stream from them to the govt not only that but now theyre on the govt payroll via unemployment all this so they can profit off of destruction fuck you long post im sorry tldr hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities my position 914 shares of gme and one 35 $100 call the shares id be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share maybe 5 who knows 42069 per share has a nice ring to it i like the stock and this isnt financial advice hedge funds are cucks

6340,983,2021-02-27 21:31:33,to all of you apes that consider buying into gme but hesitate because you want to find the perfect entry point you will never find it thats just how it is believe it or not but finding the perfect entry and perfect exit point is pure luck so you can wait and hope for gme to dip some more so you can buy in more cheaply but chances are at least as high that it takes off soon and you missed your chance thinking i wish i bought in 100 rather than 250 what you learn from that well assuming you believe that gme has a solid chance of reaching 1000$ and more it simply does not matter whether your entry point was 100 or 80 or 150 tldr you will not find it so just buy while it still is in the 23 digit range edit given that you believe in this rocket obligatory this is not financial advice just my personal opinion and i like the stock
37,97,2021-02-27 13:47:42,what would you do if robinhood goes public saw news flash that robinhood might be filing a secret ipo around march news flair section also have posts about it was trying to game out what to do should robinhood goes ipo and reasons for actions a short talk about poetic justice robinhood screwed retail investors in the gme squeeze and it is time to squeeze back besides there are ample footings for shorting robinhood the gme squeeze has exposed robinhoods shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes to file such a hasty ipo when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early b long regardless of all the shortfalls robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market it still has a strong loyal and ever expanding user base including many in this subreddit revenue shot up more than 500 in 2020 even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with robinhood wont die out c just a normal stock not boomers favorite value stock but not tendies or stonk either just something out there in the market maybe a stock to park some idle money but wont expect a yolo gainloss d dont even want to touch it like exwife or exhusband better be gone and stay gone what would you do
7089,1329,2021-02-27 12:44:52,gme may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market i did some research analysis before i start i just want to say i am writing this because last time i put up speculative dd and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized being that i have a scientific background i decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one i hope some of you find it meaningful and i would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism hypothesis gme is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market new york stock exchange nya market cap $229 trillion 2400 stock listings nasdaq ixic market cap 3300 listings sp 500mc $3161 trillion dow jones industrial average djia market cap $833 trillion 30 largest of nya and nasdaq tldrabstract i compare the relationship between gme and the worlds largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical ytd quotes the data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between gme and both the nya and djia the data didnt suggest that there is a significant relationship between ixic and gme but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship as gme rises the market responds by dropping based on this data my prediction is that wsb and gme holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market if this data is accurate then gme can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just gme indicators but also prospective market strategiespositions in short when gme goes up the market goes down tldr for data i found that the nya djia and ixic are negatively correlated to gme nya nyap 0027 djia p 0018 nasdaq p 088 start i noticed that anytime gme is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red my thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle gme the whole entire market falls as a result however whenever i mentioned this idea ive been met with opposition so i decided to compare the gme to the market indices i mentioned above x200b gme djia ixic nya ytd data if you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in gme price meaning while the whole market collapses gme rises the opposite is also true as gme drops the rest of the market rises the trends based on these comparisons suggest that gme is to some degree controlling the entire market i decided to use some statistics so i can see the likelihood that these are coincidences as many have suggested process i calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on ytd data from yahoo finance of gme nya djia ixic all data can be found there x200b covariance correlation matrices p values statistically significant values highlighted the results show that there is clear covariance between gme and all of the markets i mentioned the correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between gme and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices but what was most important was the p values between gme and the nyadjia for those that are not into statistics the pvalue is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on luck or chance it is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance any pvalue less than 05 is considered statistically significant a pvalue less than 05 basically says that there is less than a 5 chance that the relationships are due to luck as you can see there is a 27 chance that the nya dropping is random and a 18 chance for the djia while the ixic does not fit the bill i believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing nya to ixic or when comparing djia to ixic so what does this mean my opinions to me this means that gme does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uberrich but rather a battle for the entire market on january 26 the djia dropped 600 points the ixic 300 points and nya 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in gme imagine what would happen if gme hit a thousand dollars at this point you may be worried that gme may impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top 10 own 88 of the entire market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted its theirs my opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen that liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market final thoughts disclaimers anyway this is just something i wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything none of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it i would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there i also want to clarify that this was based on limited ytd data i tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff if anyone has access to quality data i would love to sink my teeth into it i am not a financial advisor edit wow i am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement i received from the community thank you all so much i also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation there is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable in a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the ptest the ptest essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between 2 variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck if you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant for instance vitamin b 12 claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no in laymans terms the ptest with regards to gme and nya basically says that according to the data provided there is a 27 chance that the two are unrelated or a 9973 chance they are related in the scientific community anything below 5 or less than 05 is considered statistically significant also i didnt just test correlation i also tested covariance covariance is not the same as correlation covariance measures the direction of the relationship in this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship meaning when one goes up the other one goes down so with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship apart from that it does not say why or how they related that is purely speculation and i clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data i am not convincing you to buy into mine lastly ive seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data all i have to say is that i spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of 500 dollars per data set not to mention a bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year if someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and i will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it other than that thank you all so much for the support and awards edit 2 the first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility ubig_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between gme and djia he got a correlation coefficient of 053 which is close to mine of 049 ubig_boolean graph for those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post post your results and i will add them on for reference i used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations edit3 ive started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and indepth understanding of applied statistics than i do to all of you experts i welcome your criticism being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed i would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that i can take a swing at myself or better yet im sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own dd considering you are experts in your fields if you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better pointing out problemsfaults is important but providing actionable solutions even more so
130,163,2021-02-27 12:32:35,am i wrong about the gme float google says that gme has a float of 45m there are 9m wsb members if every here has an average of 5 shares that would be the entire float i have seen people posting about holding thousands of shares dfv has 100k shares i have a couple of friends that have 25 shares a piece will someone explain how the hfs could short this stock at 10 and even have a chance i think if we hold were going to the positions 40 shares of gme less than the peak and higher than the low points tldr edit i didnt mean this to be a roll call of sorts but by all means lets get an idea of how many shares we all have here

809,153,2021-02-27 08:27:14,a short squeeze for dummies in 10 points so for all my fellow apes who recently joined and may be unsure exactly what a short squeeze is 1 we own shares that melvin and friends need to buy at some stage from us to cover their short positions 2 they were naked short selling which means they got extra greedy sold shares that didnt even exist and wanted to bankrupt gamestop if they had succeeded in bankrupting gamestop they would never have had to buy back the shares to cover their shorts and their illegal short selling would never have been known 3 apes discovered this and told other apes so before melvin could bankrupt gamestop all the apes started buying gme stock to thwart melvins evil plan 4 now that gamestop has been saved melvin will have to buy back the shares they shorted and its a lot 5 they must buy the shares from us and we can offer it to them for whatever price we like 6 because we will want so much money from then for each share theyre gonna be forced to sell everything they own to pay for it this includes all the other shares they own 7 the market knows this might happen so everyone starts selling shares in other companies either to be out of the market for the upcoming turmoil or to buy gme shares 8 eventually the entire market can fall massively except gme 9 this is the squeeze the value of the entire market gets squeezed into 1 stock gme imagine the stock market is an orange being squeezed into a glass gme is the glass 10 gme holders now have massive profits and go buy up all the other shares for cheap in the stock market we are the new 1 but because we know what life is like on the bottom we will be generous with our profits when the squeeze is done the world will be a better place
855,135,2021-02-27 08:10:28,anyone feeling the stressed about gme see these charts x200b this is gme this is your rocket ship its currently fueling up this is a chart for gme the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once for all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go the faster you go higher this trend started in august it will likely continue as long as ryan cohen and the folks he brought over do good work now lets address those large spikes x200b january ape welcoming party no despair here see this its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble dont panic just breathe and read if youre having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you see so a speculation bubble occurred but why what caused it and what does that mean going forward especially with the recent activity yesterday and today firstly i am not a financial advisor and i dont give financial advice secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy gme duh news goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy paper hands sell ok but that sounds really bad right again not necessarily bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months one of the things that makes gme such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap this important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations in fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on the less water available shares the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes mad max and you have all the water to yourself so the speculation boils down tois this the squeeze did it squouze am i too late so what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400 well nothing the price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before all the while costing the shorts more and more interest until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and youre wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldnt really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves or they could lie to you and double down historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money personally i dont think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own i think that it will end in one of 3 ways 1 sec will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away and a scapegoat will be offered to the public 2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and theyll go belly up 3 the shorts are right and were either too dumb or too distracted to out last them just to be clear these are all short term endings the long term end is basically cohen and friends save gamestop and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse or they dont they got a pretty good track record though i mean chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what gamestop is dont get me wrong i love my dogs but i spend way more on video games each year than i do on pet food and supplies and i dont think im the only one ok so that covers jan but what about today and yesterday well yeah short answer is im not sure but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype this would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture volatility is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition catalyst x200b just so you know i where i stand tldr i like the stock diamond hands buy the dip edit obligatory emojis edit 2 my first awards yay

21,16,2021-03-02 16:36:25,a bidask too far i had a picture that goes with this post but i guess somewhere i have shared it before makes one of the zjz bots recognize it and automatically take it down a picture is worth a thousand words so this might take a bit february 25 at 942 am after a night of gme rocketing its way back into the limelight one of the most peculiar things i have ever seen in my days of watching charts happened for several minutes the bidask spread for gme was 50 points in the picture you can clearly see a bid of 125 and an ask of 174 it was there i stared at it for some time that morning in disbelief before you ask no that wasnt when the trading was halted and you may ask what shares traded at they seemed to all trade at a price of either 12404 or 12405 what is even funnier is that if you go back to the te and trade there were 10s of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of shares that traded there if you look at the bidask price on the books it is you guessed it b12404 a12405 now i am just a fucking retard but even i can see that some record has been changed here you can literally scroll for 10 minutes as fast as you can scroll through time and trade and you will see the same prices i think it is worth some attention dm me for pictures if you wish

227,70,2021-03-02 12:41:55,gme chart analysis indicators showing bullish potential okay ill try posting this once more since i cant seem to get the formatting right before fully jumping in i need to say the obvious i am not a financial advisor this is not advice i am not an expert just having fun i encourage people to poke as many holes in this as they see fit it helps me improve but also gives me a chance to further back this up x200b circle in blue looking at the macd one of the indicators ive been following religiously through today and last week for those following my posts i like the indicator helps give me an idea where momentum is headed particularly when the scale of the chart is larger i still watch the indicator when im tracking the stock with 1m candles but its less helpful and predictable but when its in the 1d time scale it becomes more reliable since its less reactive to small jumps anyways we are starting to see an uptick in the macd where on the 25th of feb we saw the first crossover since the 4th of jan you know right before things went ballistic i digress thats not what this dd is meant to point out but its a fun observation even better momentum is climbing steadily even after a weaker performance thursfri for those who arent as familiar with macd i encourage you to check out the investopedia on it super helpful and explains it better than i ever could we see the 12 period avg not only crossed over but as of today is firmly in the positive region meaning we are in a bullish period now this is only encouraging the price to rise although does not guarantee it gme is moving into a bullish region for the first time in over a month which is really going to help push things up arrows in green i now draw your attention to my awful green arrows on the rsi indicator i include this because it backs up what is reflected in the macd indicator that gme is slowly becoming more and more bullish rsi i once again encourage reviewing investopedia for this direct link below in essence reflects proportion of buyers against sellers within an avgd highlow band for the period as that purple line creeps upward the of traders buying over selling is increasing if the purple line breaks above the dotted line the stock is considered overbought but i reckon for gme that wouldnt be an issue in fact as gme moves to being overbought volatility will reenter the stock as fundamentalists get worried so those of you who have been missing that i have good news oh and what happened the last time it went into the overbought region double check the chart for that one once again not the entire point of the dd and im not claiming the squeeze will happen as soon as it crosses over but certainly it pushes things it an optimistic direction macd and rsi are not 100 correlated although they do sometimes move together using both indicators to strengthen the bull thesis is compounding gme has entered the buyers market according to these indicators we closed today 20210301 with rsi 5786 a really nice number if you ask me there also appears to be a slight cup and handle trend showing up now im not a huge fan of predicting movements solely on these kinds of trends and i think its a weak trend at that but i know this will be someones cup of tea im not great at reading those visual trends my thoughts i like $gme memes aside the fundamentals are there i really like the chewy potential dd and that has been what i tend to gravitate towards in my explanations of why a squeeze doesnt matter entirely what i mean by that is even after a squeeze gamestop has a lot going for it so im not worried if i miss the peak the tldr of that dd is if the market cap of gme hits chewy the price could be at $600 on natural growth the company has some great value transitioning to online only already we are seeing graphics cards sold a new market for gamestop a big step towards the one stop shop envisioned besides that gaming is one of the fastest growing industries ive seen dd for $crsr explaining that industry growth will be a great catalyst moving forward

45,21,2021-03-02 03:56:28,which call contracts creates the best chances for another gamma squeeze in the first gme squeeze we saw 4 gamma squeezes leading up to the climax in late jan early feb these squeezes took place over the course of the whole month of jan starting with the squeeze that shot the price up from 20 to 50 then to 100 and then two more in the weeks leading up to robinhood fucking us the gamma squeeze worked as a catalyst the first time around and its probably our biggest ally going into this second run through gamma is at its highest when the price of the stock is at the strike price of the option contract so the best way to increase the chances of a gamma squeeze is to buy calls that are otm but not too far otm so with a market price of 110 buying up calls with strike prices between 110 to 160 is good for a better explanation of why this is read this also one thing to note is trading your deep itm calls for otm calls may reduce the delta hedge necessary reducing the amount of gme needed to be bought by market makers tldr buy otm calls with a strike price near market price to increase chances of a gamma squeeze and avoid trading deep itm calls for deep otm calls not financial advice

16,28,2021-03-04 13:22:10,who is the whale of wall street if theres one thing wall street likes to do its make money if theres an opportunity to make money they will take it its literally their job nothing personal just business stock market isnt just about fundamentals its about many things there are sharks in wall street if they smell blood they will come for you there is no friendship just greed greed to make money remember when wall street turned on bear stearns and lehman brothers in 20078 if banks can go after other banks they can and will go after hedgies now imagine youre a whale with a lot of liquid cash lets say warren buffet you see gme being shorted more than 100 and think i can make billions here from a short squeeze so you literally buy every share out there especially those from the short sellers you now own more than 100 of gme fast forward gme gets new management and does well you continue to diamond hand eventually those that lent their shares to the shorters are asking for them back now and now comes the time where the shorters must buy to cover and give them back to the lender except no one is selling because they have none to sell the only person with shares to sell is warren buffet he simply says $69420 per share is my price what can the hedgies who shorted do they must buy them from him and cover their position if they do not cover hedgies will get margin called and liquidated by their broker for all they are worth if they can not put up the money that is needed to buy those shares this is what almost happened to melvin in january the $3 billion cash injection from citadel and point72 was to cover the margin so that their broker doesnt liquidate $3 billion of melvins assets to cover the loss if melvin cannot pay their broker must foot the bill this is why the broker will protect themselves and why they asked melvin to put up $3 billion cash as insurance or get forcibly liquidated for that much there are much smarter people in wall street with much bigger pockets than melvin and whoever else shorted gme melvin is finished others in wall street have seen the opportunity to make billions and have their plans in motion we are just along for the ride it seems as you know these whales play by different rules and so can do things retail cant it doesnt matter what melvin does now whether theyve hedged against the price going up or down now it doesnt matter their first gme play their original shorting which was arrogantly and ironically unhedged is still in play and that will sooner or later end them what they are doing now is just kicking the can down the road in fact it should of ended them in late january if not for robinhood pulling the plug mathematically they are finished the only thing that can save them is if their original plan comes true and gme gets bankrupt but that doesnt look like itll happen any time soon who is the whale of wall street or maybe who are the whales of wall street are they going ever going to be revealed will they be in the inevitable movie note the warren buffet part was just an example of something that whales could be doing or have done for the past month im not saying he is the whale or has any interest in gme everything here is just my personal belief and opinion and not financial advice i believe gme has a bright future and that the company will do great things i just like the stock

3630,570,2021-03-03 22:58:35,i love this community but we need to talk ive been a longtime lurker in this sub even before i grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market the variety of people the thoroughness of their research and the veracity with which they defend it make this place what it is i only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic with modest success my biggest wins came from wsb when the real push on gme started i was there i was a bag holder of gme after january but my bag wasnt too large and i liked the stock so i grew some diamond hands and held i started really following the daytoday threads reading every piece of financial news i could watched bruce eat his bagels and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general i dont listen to all the advice i see on here and i dont blindly trust dd why i feel i need to post today the mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours the rift i see between the gme folks and the rkt folks saddens me greatly i dont know exactly how i fee about rkt something just seems too contrived about it ive seen some dd that suggests its a hf ploy to pull people out of gme if thats the case i dont think it will be successful gme apes are strong you dont just lose your diamond hands on a whim ive seen other dd that suggests its a hf hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in gmeamc this seems a bit more plausible to me but im still not 100 convinced a lot of people are posting massive gains sincere congratulations what conclusion i have come to is this if i were a hf or a mm who needed wsb to fracture i would seed disunity and distrust among the community i would send every bot or shill i could in every direction some strongly defending rkt some tearing it down some screaming gme is dead while others quietly suggest taking gains from rkt and rolling them into uwmc i wouldnt suggest a shit stock that i knew nobody would listen about i would use my best dd and find something that could tear attention away from gme and tear the community apart and unfortunately i think its starting to work just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3yearolds argue about what superhero would win in a fight i love this community i hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference when it comes to money its easy to manipulate peoples feelings i just hope that in the end apes together strong is the sentiment good luck today everyone and thank you

689,155,2021-03-03 12:49:21,a word of caution about whats to come before you take my order of french fries and a large frosty i wanted to tell you a story im a long time lurker in the wsb and i have been following the gme saga since december unfortunately i jumped in too late so i bought 4 shares at 350 on jan 28th and i have been holding them with my life also i kept buying more to average down i have the same mentally as most of people here i believe in the company and all the changes its doing so i do believe that even if the ss doesnt happen having gme stock is an amazing investment but fear not there is enough evidence to know that its not a matter of if the ss happens or not is just a matter of when its going to happen anyways what i wanted to say is when the moass happens you need to be prepared specially mentally prepared for the ultra bumpy ride i have the feeling that everyone here thinks that once the rocket takes off everything is going to be a smooth ride and you just need to wait for the perfect time to sell and become rich i have bad news for you it wont be like that if you think that this last weeks between hfs hiding information media publishing shitty articles about why you shouldnt invest in gme a bald dude on tv talking crap about the stock or reddit all the short ladder attacks bots shills lying to the congressetc is crazy just wait until this thing explodes i presume most of us or probably all of us have seen a movie where a space ship goes through an asteroid belt thats going to be our rocket thats going to be this forum and its going to be pandemonium i do believe and admire the collective wisdom this is the reason why all the dds we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes for what it matters is the same however i do also believe in mass panic and panic and fear are really strong emotions every single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time logic intelligence and incredible well done dds are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago greed is what put the hf in this situation fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40s range in this game when people lose fear all that is left is greed and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly we can easily surpass the 100k but it can be our demise as well dont forget its not the same a hf having a civilized fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120 and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1000500010000 in that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start so be prepared that everything and anything can happen and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself and im not telling you to lets stay together until the end fuck no we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way great but if not ill cry alone on top of my pile of money however what im really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check dont be a fool thinking its going to be a smooth ride be as greedy as fuck translation hold like your life depends on it cause it does and please tldr dont panic and carry a towel x200b ps probably you can tell english is not my first language soviva méxico putos ps2 obligatory i have no clue how to put emojis from the computer so me gusta la acción y manos de diamante

100,300,2021-03-03 11:13:19,sell off your original investment in gme at $1000 i would hope that all you autists out there would already have an exit strategy in place but maybe youve been eating too many crayons lately so i thought id just make a post so its out there for everyone i think that once gme hits $1000 on this squeeze every one of you should try recover your original investment in order to remove the emotional element of holding for example if you invested $1000 to buy 10 shares of gme at a sp of $100 and we squeeze to $1000i would recommend that you sell off 1 share of gme to recover your original $1000 then just hold the fuck out of the other 9 shares until we hit some ridiculous share price once again this isnt groundbreaking information but i thought it should be said let me know what you apes think and if youre stuck thinking about it maybe you can ask your wifes boyfriend for some advise dont 
49,73,2021-03-03 11:03:22,banana talk rkt and gme in my opinion rkt is a very good attempt at diverting people away from gme i can agree with most people that rkt may have been under valued due to the recent dividend but is rkt the next gme stock in my opinion no the key difference to gme is the short position chairmen daniel gilbert alone at rkt owns 19 billion shares 19billion 2nd link while the total available shares is only 115 million if you have been following any of the gme dd the short position on rkt is no where near gme short shorts please some one prove me wrong the only concern i see with rkt is the option chain for this week and next week its all closing in the money what does this mean im not sure exactly but looking at the chain for march 5th i can tell you puts are currently short roughly 119 million dollars so every dollar past $34 is just a win for anyone holding common stock im really just interested what other people have to say about entire option chains expire in the money any one see this before we are all apes we can eat different bananas im just want to debate bananas x200b edit 1 shorted shares dd as of 3220 the market cap for rkt currently sits at 8255 billion which is roughly 1984375000 shares at 4160 chairmen daniel gilbert alone owns 1867177661 shares leaving 117197339 shares available trade common stock that anyone can buy sits at 155million so yes ill heed everyone that rkt has been shorted at least 24 or 37802661 shares x200b
1822,811,2021-03-03 10:42:41,why its not over for rkt more shorts have reloaded important dd inside hoping this time i wont get immedately deleted 3rd times the charm x200b super tldr my pt is $735 x200b if you read my first dd and got in congrats check it out if youre late to the party there are exactly two reasons for why its not fucking over reason 1 dan and jay hate the shorts wall street has never considered rkt to be a fintech company you know whats happening tomorrow at 1015 am x200b thats right jay farner the ceo is going live with morgan stanley during a tech conference to have a fireside chat youre going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for rkt shorts youre going to tell me that theres no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends rkt to the stratosphere i have no fucking idea but i trust in dan gilbert co to win because thats all theyve done for the past 35 fucking years win x200b to make things even sweeter more dry powder is coming in tomorrow market makers making new options tomorrow remember the first time new options came out for gme if you bought even the farthest otm one it printed mm will have to remain delta netural with their new options thus they will have to buy shares therefore the more new options bought tomorrow the more fuel is loaded for a gamma squeeze x200b to close things up recall that rkt had 40 interest going into this week look at todays graph x200b notice those two drops where it halted see the strong support that immediately followed this is a textbook example of a ladder attack the shorts have reloaded at a new price shorts attempted to shake the but failed retail is not alone on this the dip is being purchased even while at an ath someone is on the long side buying up shares with retail in my opinion after today short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40 look at the candles during those short ladder attacks shorts had to have borrow millions of shares to attempt to short ladder today i wouldnt be surprised if this is melvin cos latest play to dig themselves out of their gamestop loss porn either more shorting more shorts to choke x200b x200b so thats reason 1 theres a nonzero chance jay farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere but whats reason 2 my price target for rkt is $735 lets go through the numbers x200b rkts projected eps for this year is $245 link 3 source is on sa removed link because it was getting my post deleted x200b to get pe take the price and divide by earnings thus we can use this to calculate the forward pe for rkt rkt closed at $4179 which divided by $245 is 1705 thus rkt currently trades at about a 17forward pe companies in this sector trade in between 1530 pe and since i strongly believe rkt is a growth stock i think it should trade at 30x pe thus 30 x $245 is $735 therefore my pt for rkt is $735 rkt is a fintech company and is a profitable one think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and arent even profitable you know what that means its not fucking over if suits are buying at ath im buying at ath if shorts have reloaded the squeeze has not squoze the suits agree rkt is worth more than $40 x200b tldr short interest has probably gone up suits are buying current pe is 17 growth pe in my opinion should be at least 30 rkt is still undervalued and my price target is $735 x200b remember fundamentally a great company they are still not priced as a growth stock they are still not considered fintech by the suits there is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ath i like the stock x200b my pt is $735 50 tomorrow 60 to 70 eow if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down this is not a trade x200b not financial advice i dont know anything positions 150 shares 50 $23 c 35 exp i will be exercising almost all my calls as i am long i will be purchasing otm calls tomorrow at open currently considering some $50 and $60 strike expiring 35 x200b edit saw some info that 26 million shares were shorted today no idea if its true but x200b dont forget about the special dividend $111 per share to all shareholders by eod 35 x200b hey guys who are downvoting this because its not gme know that im going to be rolling extra rkt profits into gme youre forgetting the target date for gme is 319 only got here because of gme i wont leave you guys hanging strong together x200b x200b

24,72,2021-03-03 10:01:15,too many existing shares to properly squeeze rkt this is simple math there are 17 billion more shares of rkt than there are of gme it is mathematically impossible for it to squeeze like gme will all the retail investors in the world do not have the combined purchase power to buy up enough rkt to truly squeeze it and hurt the hedgies right now all the retail investors basically hold the 20 million or so tradeable shares of gme do the retail investors physically own all the tradeable shares of rocket you know some 600 million shares nope my guess is the hfs wanted the paper hands to sell gme and buy up rkt instead then these dorks will be left holding the bag

35,60,2021-03-03 08:33:41,mods we are owed answers about rkt love you rkt idiots and i truly am happy for you that being said the rkt megathread came directly after the incredibly late 9amish gme thread and was promoted by the mods via a stickied comment that took up half the mobile screen rkt was the most talked about yesterday it sounded like straight up promotion gmes thread was opened by ubawse1 and we appreciate that but the entire mod teams needs to fully understand how important setting the comments to sort by new is not doing so kills the hype i have to go into the thread sort by new and minimize the rkt promo in order to have a decent experience what exactly will be done with the threads from now on and why did the entire mod team ignore constant tags to open a gme thread all the way until market open
47,13,2021-03-03 07:20:25,$gme dd lets talk about margin for those of you who do not know what margin is lets just simplify it to borrowed money when you open an investment account with any broker they give you the option to trade on margin the amount of margin they give you is based on your assets versus their calculated risk there are 2 key reasons trading gme or any stock you like on margin are dangerous if your goal is to score some gains off of a potential squeeze 1 shares bought on margin can be borrowed and shorted not just those shorting at the $520 level when this began but also those being shorted right now at $130 shares bought with cash your money cannot be shorted if you make your account a cash account this can effectively reduce the float 2 shares bought on margin can be called in we saw this happen with rh and other brokers in january the borrowed money was not worth the risk of loss for these firms so they executed the right to call in your borrowed assets to cover their exposed risk tldr if youre goal is to reduce the float available to shorts do not trade on margin make your account a cash account and trade with your own available cash to prevent your shares from being borrowed obligatory i am not a financial advisor i just like the stock

12,39,2021-03-05 15:38:41,ok can someone help me with this my gme situation ok first off gme to the moon obviously now that thats out of the way i bought 160 gme at $88 back in january when it first popped added 153 more at $145 before selling the initial 160 at $350 great gains wellof course me being super reeeeee about the stock plowed all those profits back in immediately and more in other accounts to the tune of the following 207 $260 80 $315 those 80 shares took a real bloodbath i guess that my question is this wouldnt it be smart to sell these shares and maybe the others that are way below the market price then immediately rebuy them the sale would show capital losses that would help to offset the initial gains i had from the sale of the 160 shares my brain is too smooth to determine if im missing something huge here but id rather not pay the fucking $9k in taxes to uncle sam who fucked up my taxes last year and still hasnt fixed things i come to you retards and autists brothers and sisters please lend me some wrinkles edit i figured it out the wash sale rule prevents me from doing this and would only leave me off the rocket ship right as its coming back for me heres the page from fidelity and the text the washsale rule states that your tax writeoff will be disallowed if you buy the same security a contract or option to buy the security or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the date you sold the lossgenerating investment people who receive stock or stocklike bonuses from their employer should also consider if their vesting date or employee stock purchase plan espp purchase date may fall within that 30day window

16,27,2021-03-04 15:47:31,thoughts  they are building systems to track mentions then publishing them on boomer news good news movements will happen quicker bad news we are constantly monitored which allows for faster adjustments less surprise effect we should find a way to communicate tickers without saying it in such a way that can be easily filtered for example or nothing crazy hard but at least a human ha to read to understand not an algo fun fact they publish all the other plays and call them targets but they refuse to acknowledge gme existence or exposure wonder why
189,71,2021-03-04 13:47:25,gme dd hf cant cover their short by the call options disclaim not financial advice first i am an international student so my grammar isnt great apologize for that first i see many people quoting the options volume trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period and open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there these contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment if we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset i see a lot of saying that hf can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become longsided first if they choose to close their position by call option it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium they may have some hedge option for their short position but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option even they choose to do so it would likely be done when gme falls to the 40 range which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive consider the iv i think they didnt even think about covering at a loss then lets take a look at the call option that expires in mar5 127232 call options are open and 31676 call options are in the money and only the options itm would be exercised 316761003167600 which only 3 million shares let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60 of the float according to finra which is 6045m27m short position so if they exercise those call options which only cover 117 of their short position it would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100200300 i didnt put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times which could hugely inflate their losses so call options cant be a good way for them to cover please correct me if i have any mistakes position 104110 edit also they may cover some of their position on the first runup and short it again when gme falling but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20 they lost money for sure and the interest rate also becomes higher which makes the second runup worse for them edit2 for those who dont know how option pricing here is the thing the more call hf purchase the more iv it is and the option price shoots up also x200b x200b 
155,47,2021-03-04 13:26:50,theory on why gme is showing weird numbers on order book my theory on order book showing high numbers obligatory this isnt a trading advice nor am i a financial advisor you do your own trades and make your own decision about your investment this is just for educational purposes only according to this article on order book i just skimmed over order book is moderately informativeits contribution to price discovery is approximately 22 the remaining 78 is from the best bid and offer prices on the book and the last transaction price its been said that the 80 of the current market is traded by algos i believe algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons 1 crazy amount of short interest 2 hfs are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist 3 wsb retards are putting $69420 for sell orders which are fucking up the hft traders 1 it is estimated that retail holds about minimum 3040 of the float estimation of 4 million people around the world holding just 3 shares each and institutions hold 12204 according to yahoo short of the float is about 60 of the float which means around 25million shares are borrowed and sold on the market if half of gme holders and half of institutions are s that means about 80 of the float is locked in this makes short interest waaaaaay higher than what is actually reported if short interest is 60 which is 25million and float is 20 of the actual float that makes the short interest 277 theres just not enough shares for short seller to cover because most of the shares are just fucking locked in 2 so these hfs who have to cover due to either share recall or losing money they make up counterfeit shares from their offshore account to buy the counterfeited shares and covering them that way they can trick the failtodeliver numbers and show the sec that they covered using shares that dont even fucking exist read this webpage on counterfeiting shares that i just skimmed over to get an overview of how counterfeiting stocks is done i believe they have gotten to a point where there are literally close to 0 shares available on the market to cover and this is fucking with the algos because the reason number 3 3 wsb retards are putting $800$69420 orders and algos are trying to get the lowest priced shares to cover short selling for hfs while skimming through nonexistent shares that are currently being traded on the market but it obviously doesnt all go through because hfs probably have some another algo to prevent some weird anomaly shit from happening now they cant cover at those numbers or theyd be out of money in 5 minutes similar event actually happened back in 2012 where hft made a company called knight capital to lose $440m in just 45 minutes in summary the algos just started buying high and selling low lol so what do they do they have to make fake shares again until either retail or institutions sell their locked up shares thank you for coming to my ted talk now ill take any questions tldr i believe algos are really fucking up their trades because of these reasons 1 crazy amount of short interest 2 hfs are abusing counterfeiting shares that do not exist 3 wsb retards are putting $69420 for sell orders which are fucking up the hft traders
715,235,2021-03-04 10:14:33,the modern day witchhunt that has become wsb and a plea for the revival of the old wsb its quite obvious that since january there has been a massive influx of new members to wsb as an open community wsb happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but im concerned about how thats changed the dynamic of the subreddit before the rise of gme wsb was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas share dd and gainsloss porn and post memes about any stock they liked or were interested in even when popular stocks like tesla and palantir came about they never 100 consumed the discussion diversity of the sub nowadays you come on the sub and literally all you see is content related to gme i personally dont mind all the gme banter however what i do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like gamestop is the only company that exists too many times have i seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off gme at the end of the day the goal of investing is to make money while gamestop is a great vehicle to do that it is not the only means of making money in the stock market while i am saying all this there really isnt any real way that i can think of at least to remedy this issue and this post probably wont get the publicity and visibility that it needs to make a change however i want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain open minded allow there to be room on the sub for genuinely great ideas to grow and flourish and receive the attention they deserve stay safe yall
32,10,2021-03-04 08:24:58,could a market crash be rocket fuel for gme ive been doing a lot of research on gme mainly through the smooth brained ape posts within wsb one idea that seemed to come up quite a bit was that gme could cause a market crash due to the hf needing to readjusted how they were leveraged out but what if a crash happened organically if we are at a market top and see significant pullback wouldnt the hf have to readjust their short positions since their long equity would be reduced by the crash in turn being the rocket fuel to this is not financial advice i am not a cat 306 gme 118

87,14,2021-03-04 07:56:22,dd aso gme fuel hopefully you made money from the weed stock bump last month and rkt this week the following is aso dd and why it could take gme to the next level based on reinvesting gains academy sports outdoors aso beat last quarters earnings by 2x times predictions my thesis involves a run up to the q4 earnings report march 31 besides the company consistently outperforming market expectations it currently sits as the third most shorted stock under gme and tanger since the pandemic began gun and ammo sales have been going through the roof you may think this would be a negative factor going forward as things calm down but january 2021 had the 3rd highest gun sales record in history ammo stocks have seen a boost but then a drop as they report they cannot keep up with supply hunting fishing camping kayaking and other outdoor hobbies have seen a huge increase since the pandemic began this shit aint over fokes and we know how much autists spend on new hobbies texas is opening back up and eliminating the mask mandate texas has almost 10 of the us population and they love guns ammo and the outdoors aso is going to be absolutely packed on top of that theyre all about to receive that sweet stimey money and it sure isnt going into investments this will undoubtably create positive sentiment articles so this all sounds like a long term bull case right wrong aso has seen huge spikes in 2021 as have most of the most heavily shorted stocks this one has the financials and positive momentum to keep it going if it garners enough interest as rkt did a pop is bound to happen as people see the value how does this affect gme have you seen the posts of people reinvesting gains from rkt and weed stocks this is the next stop on the road to the moon ps im drunk on tendies so excuse misspellings grammar and lack of charts

81,55,2021-03-04 06:29:51,$sdc upcoming earnings high short interest hello fellow autists since weve all been interested in high short interest stocks for possible squeeze events one thing came up on my radar called $sdc smile direct club they are a teledentistry platform that provides members with a customized clear aligner therapy treatment in the united states and internationally the company took a pretty big hit in revenue during the pandemic last year but has been recovering over the past few quarters ill leave chart for dumb dumbs below given that before the pandemic they were trading at 16 20 dollars a share which i believe is totally undervalued given the fact that they just got a deal with metlife a major insurance company in november the company should be on a one way ticket to tendie town x200b the short interest on this company is massive 25 of the entire stock is short which ill leave a screen cap below for proof one final note our good friends at citadel have also decided to join in on the fun for shorting the company ill leave a screen cap of their most recent 13f form but wouldnt it be hilarious if they take yet another l when it comes to wsb and high short interest stocks yes i know it was melvin capitol who held the position for gme but still involved with rh on the trade shutdown x200b x200b tldr sdc to the moon im all in on calls for april 16 and buying shares
1119,119,2021-03-04 05:48:18,draining the swamp gme notable hires necessary disclosure im not a financial advisor and i have no idea what im talking about i just like the stock x200b long ago when dfv started preaching the gme bull case he saw it as a value buy he did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store when people compared gamestop to blockbuster he laughed since gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention he has been under a microscope billions of dollars see him as the leader and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons given the wave of new hires i thought now would be a good time to formally discuss the companys mid to long term potential x200b the ryan cohen vision if you have any money in gamestop you better already know this part that being said you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again ryan cohen founded chewy in 2011 and served as the ceo until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3b this marked the largestever acquisition of an ecommerce company and speaks to rcs expertise in ecommerce this man is the messiah x200b on 111620 cohen formally wrote a letter to the gamestop board of directions detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it within it he discussed the growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer the large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program gamestops unwillingness to change with the times gamestops hardships amid the gaming boom x200b his letter made it clear that he has a vision for what gamestop could be and that he has a plan to get it there he recently upped his stake from 91291 on 11221 which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround if we have any chance of making it to valhalla ryan cohen will lead us x200b draining the swamp as cohen expressed in his letter one of the main reasons for gamestops fall was its lack of competent leadership the ship has been sinking for years and its crew has been suspiciously negligent while conspiracy theories exist that gamestop execs tanked the company in an effort to insider trade with hedge funds well keep the tinfoil hats off today jim bell former cfo on february 23rd 2021 it was announced that jim bell cfo would be resigning myself and many others believe that he was forced out by the new wave which is supported by this article his background shows he worked primarily with brick and mortar establishments which wont be relevant for the rc vision x200b new board nominees source on january 11th 2021 it was announced that alan attal ryan cohen and jim grube are new nominees for the board of directors they stand up for election at the annual meeting of stockholders which is expected to take place in june 2021 x200b alan attal former chewy cmo and coo one of cohens chewy buddies attal will serve a valuable role in gamestops transformation to the digital age he specializes in ecommerce marketing and could help tapping into gamestops 55 million customers registered to their rewards program x200b ryan cohen the messiah enough said x200b jim grube former chewy cfo grube specializes in ecommerce which is especially crucial for gamestops current situation while has not yet been appointed cfo of gamestop i find him to be the most likely candidate if so he will be tasked with the trainwreck that is gamestop x200b board nominees likely not up for reelection lizabeth dunn raul fernandez james k symancyk and kathy vrabeck im too lazy to get into detail here but these people are dead weight and do not seem to align with the cohen vision x200b x200b other notable hires matt francis cto francis began working for gamestop on 21521 he has worked in the ecommerce industry for more than two decades and recently worked with amazon web services he could play a big role in the modernization of gamestops business model source his linkedin profile x200b kelli durkin senior vp of customer care durkin began working for gamestop on 3121 and was part of the rc chewy cohort she will bring her worldclass customer service operation to gamestop and could help to tap into the large customer base that was mentioned earlier her linkedin profile x200b josh kreuger vice president of fulfillment krueger previously worked for amazon and walmart and began working on 3121 his job is especially critical as gamestops ability to fulfill orders in a timely fashion will ultimately determine their ability to compete with competitors his linkedin profile x200b notable differences as many of you have pointed out gamestop has already made a few concrete changes which is quite impressive they now offer sameday delivery to many locations by utilizing doordash they were able to tap into a stable network and instantly made themselves a competitor they have also added many pc parts such as gfx cards to their website while it may be too soon for these new hires to have caused these changes they are firststeps in making gamestop the powerhouse that it once was x200b tldr lots of good new hires and bad people being let down i like the stock comment from utalascio points out the next big gme move to look out for is probably going to be the current ceo george sherman resigning before becoming the ceo of gamestop sherman was the ceo of victra a verizon retailer that runs brick and mortar verizon stores his tenure at victra was extremely short leading me to believe he wasnt the easiest person to work with and found a home in the precohen gamestop swamp not to mention that a ceo that specializes in bm locations is the polar opposite of the future vision for gme the news that sherman has resigned is going to be an insane catalyst things are only looking good from here on out

19,13,2021-03-04 05:16:37,how i use wsb a noobs take on rwsb ive been trading stocks very passively since robinhood became available i would watch a little cnbc try to identify bargains then purchase some stock and try to ignore it now i am trading actively every day im a fulltime undergraduate math student and i just got accepted into a graduate program so its pretty likely that i will be back to doing passive investing by fall 2021 fyi i might be studying math finance i first heard about wsb through my buddy who started getting into options when we got our stimulus last june his take was that he was too poor for $1200 to matter very much and that if the economy tanked that wouldnt do him very much good i think he was pretty actively engaged made about $5000 i know hes still around here but he has a regular job so i doubt hes as active as he was back then trading is work its kind of like being in business for yourself a bit like being a professional gambler and i dont think any of these things means it deserves any stigma there are psychological labor and decision fatigue and it stays with you after the markets close and on the weekends i started drinking more and started using a little more thc none of these things are of major concern i dont consider my day trading or substance use any kind of addiction i joined wsb when gme was popping off i had been paying attention to the news but didnt buy in till it was about $350 on that wednesday yes wsb influenced my decision so did the youtuber in the money but i dont think anybody could have predicted the way in which the squeeze was going to be kneecapped that next morning i stayed on wsb trying to figure out the good info from the bad info i posted to another website about gme when gme stabilized around $50 i was down $6k not to mention the fact i had sold my mj stocks to buy gme i really shouldve used cash which i couldve deposited i didnt really let any of this get to me we all have our reasons for wanting to make money imo it was worth the risk which is why im still here however if i want to keep trading i cant yolo my money into a meme stock im a student with no income so i started getting more serious about options trading i dont do high probability trading i just look at charts and buy options based on which direction the price is moving ive seen videos about the greeks but i really dont pay that close attention to things other than the bidask spread and iv i like options because theyre leveraged and i can make money on bearish positions how does wsb fit into my trading strategy i look for meme stocks read the dd and then look at the chart if i like the chart i might try a trade if i dont like it i might ignore it or add it to a watchlist its pretty simple and its helped me identify many profitable trades i comment on stuff in the daily thread sometimes i answer a question i shit post a little i call out bs but i dont push my gay af communism on yall this is the only reddit i am on and the only social media im on is mastadon and a few discord channels if youve read this you probably arent someone constantly screaming in the daily if youre new here like me please dont fuck it up stop screaming in the daily thread about every little movement of your meme stock the risk is that we eventually need stricter gatekeeping and thats very intensive and difficult we might even be targeted by regulators which would make wall street very happy one final mention is about information security infosec is about keeping private info private and public info accurate i can guarantee you that we have the attention of every major intelligence apparatus private public government etc watching what were doing there are shills influencers bots and badactors this is just a part of any public movement if you want to read about the way states organize their counterintelligence efforts heres a link to a wikipedia page thanks for taking the time to read i hope that this has been a helpful perspective on wsb from a noob go bers

87,47,2021-03-04 05:10:11,why you should hodl your gme so dfv has calls that expire april 16th for 500 contracts on gme at $12 for smooth brains thats 50000 shares hes already doubled down on his share position as stated during the congressional hearing on gme what if what if he decides to exercise his options at his strike price lets say his strike price is $1250 that would cost him $625000 a small chunk of change compared to what hes made so now what the hedgies need to deliver thats 50000 shares at what the current price is or what ever price they are currently holding on to in their war chest would this increase the share price exponentially keeping in mind all the other calls they need to cover i think if he does exercise his options this could easily hit $800 unless my thinking is all wrong might need a smarter ape to chime in edit everyone keeps fixating on the 50000 number i also said keep in mind all the other calls they need to cover i guess i shouldve clarified that better my bad i know his 50k shares wouldnt alone wont raise the price alone i would assume that a huge portion of the calls will get sold for profit but dfv would exercise his call and buy the shares however with the amount of calls in the money with those electing to purchase the shares would this not basically increase the price thus setting off a chain reaction of calls in the money

539,318,2021-03-05 00:19:20,why $uwmc is still most definitely the play alright yall yesterday a lot of you apes bought in as the price zoomed up premarket and are now bagholding and freaking out dont fret my fellow degenerates if you woke up and looked at the price premarket today you probably got spooked but it has been a brutal 24 hours for the market good thing $uwmc is a long term hold yes there will be volatility this week and next as traders look for day trade and swing trade moves but i cannot wait for 319 id argue yesterday was a pretty damn good day for $uwmc regardless of entry price i personally would have used those dips to average down and accumulate some shares but what do i know im just a smooth brained bag holder anyway uwmc still ended up green 5 shoutout gme for finishing green as well do i need to remind you guys what happened to $rkt yesterday a lot of those investors jumped ship and hopped on $uwmc but at the same time $rkts demise certainly scared some potential $uwmc investors away kinda oxymoronic uwmc has its own momentum and will get to orbit regardless of what $rkt does due to all of the catalysts and intangibles i mentioned in my first dd tldr dividend date 310 and russell 1000 3000 index addition 322 the shorts were all over uwmc yesterday it went from 1000000 available shares shorted on 32 to under 90000 shares available to short by market close yesterday editing for transparency looks like some shorts have closed their positions and its up to 250000 short shares available as of 915 of course the institutions are gonna jump all over this once they see wsb talking about it because they know there are a lot of paper hands who will get scared and sell but diamond hands are needed to beat these losers while a short squeeze is certainly possible i think the true potential comes in the form of a gamma squeeze look at all these calls for 319 if $uwmc can stay above $10 this has the potential to go to mars and fly right past the moon i would like to add that while all this options activity is fantastic it will be all for nothing if the contracts arent backed up with shares ill personally be loading up on shares while this thing is still reasonably priced take care of yourselves since theres no daily thread for uwmc feel free to unload here disclaimer i own shares of $uwmc and have contracts expiring in april and may i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice update uwmc ceo just declared war on rocket mortgages

9,1,2021-03-07 19:55:18,round 3 wsb has over nine million members lets take 20 of those members as avid affiliates thats 18 million 1800000 1000 18 billion and if the autists use all of the $1400 checks thats 252$ billion added valuation to a 961$ billion current gme capitalization if we take 18$ billion thats about a 19 percent rally but lets compound that by the rallies leading up to the catalyst and remember we used 20 of the 9 million wsb membership what happens when 50 of the wsb uses their stimulus check to buy gme 4000000 1000 thats a whopping 4$ billion added valuation 4000000 1400 56 billion usd added value lets optimize to 80 of the community 7200000 members 7200000 1000 72 billion $7200000 1400 1008 billion usd in conclusion gme stock has a catalyst to increase by 19 104 whats more extraordinary is dumb money citadel melvin capital and the likes probably made similar speculation as above and will buy in before the catalyst happensprobably and lets not forget all the people that are smarter than me that came to the same conclusion lets get ready to rumble
7070,927,2021-03-07 13:01:57,chamath palihapitiya dd snake oil salesman a lot of people view this guy as a hero but i see through his bullshit im going to list a few things this guy has did recently that has made me raise an eyebrow you can decide for yourself if you like this guy or not 1 ρ ump and dumped gme he sent out a tweet buying gme and then sold it later the same day without sending out a sale tweet he realized people had an issue with this then decided to donate the profits to charity the problem with this is not only did he make his followers bag hold but he also gets a free tax write off from them 2 ρ ump and dumped virgin galactic for months he ranted and raved about how great this company is only to completely sell his entire stake while still being chairman of the company without warning anyone 3railed robinhood for order flow but his sofi does the same thing 4 running for governor of ca to lower his own taxes and enrich his friends this guy is your typical politician but instead of campaigning for offices he is campaigning for you to buy his spacsstocks dont buy into the good guy bull shit he just wants to enrich himself off of you i like some of his stocks but i wont be touching them after looking into him x200b edit requested in the comments 
0,15,2021-03-05 07:36:42,are gme spikes helping shorts i have a question hoping for someone much smarter to explain x200b wont these small spikes as weve seen week of feb26 and just today week of mar5 help shorts and couldnt they be engineered by shorts as well the thing that really helps with running up the option chain is if there are enough options bought and you force delta hedging especially with a stock like gme if the price is very stable for a period of time like after the jan squeeze for a few weeks then the price of those options drop and a lot of people were able to buy them for example the $115c was something like $150 per contract prior to the runup we had week of feb26 and a lot of people were able to profit massively and im assuming many used the profits to buy more shares good ape move however after that spike all the contracts going forward became much more expensive as the premiums and volatility went through the roof this week i was able to nag $200c for $16 and sold some for $8 which was a blessing but it seems to me a spike or so every week keeps options prices high and thus prevents retailers from being able to afford call options which seems like a bit of a win for short sellers is this logic sound at all im dumb so any advice is helpful but i had been waiting all week for premiums to drop on call options so i could afford a few that wasnt so out of the money if the pattern continues then leading up to week of mar19 and earnings mar26 premiums would get bumped up week after week maybe having the price itself stable at incremental steps up week to week far outweighs the options side of things thoughts x200b im sure jn_ku would be able to explain haha

53,17,2021-03-08 15:55:54,forbes article about $gme situation and the bunch of redditwsb is actually well meant imho hey fellow investor i read a lot of reactions on several postst this weekend surrounding this article where people felt attacked by the author x200b tldr he thinks youre an intelligent group of people x200b imho my thought is that the author actually although the words might sound a bit negative is giving the gme bunch on wsb a huge compliment being an intelligent mostly rational purpose and target focussed hurde x200b intelligent predatory behaviour involves social behaviour raptors wolves killer whales etc etc those animals we are animals as well no are interacting really socially in daily life and to sustain and expand the group always need to work together to survice x200b based on wsb sometimes very good dd about the situation in january and as of now not the gamestop fundamentals for long term investing dd about short position and option chains so purely interpreting data by us all and discussing among us leading to a common goal and the target needed to be taken down to reach that goal is a hunt right x200b the hfs being defenseless i think the author solely states the outcome is inevitable much like we know it is and that they know too and therefore hfmm cant but slow the process down not stop it from happening thats what we conlcuded right and he agrees x200b so will the outcome will be as we think it will be want it to be lets hope so but sometimes prey escape it is what it is x200b side info i cant comment in threads due to karma issues obviously and so i cant eventually get karma by reactions so that i can comment looks like a loop to me but please understand that me not reacting to you is not ignoring you hell ive learned a lot by not ignoring you same as the media is not ignoring you
0,21,2021-03-06 04:28:44,why i choose to invest on petroleum companies cpe hi guys i discovered wsb in january with the gme controversy and i read every one of your post since then i lost some money on gme made a little back on rkt but now i think i found my own strategy and i am going to invest on oil one of the sectors that took a massive hit with the virus x200b basicaly there are 2 options for the future either mankind find another source of energy either oil will become super super expensive because we will always need it for some tasks my idea is to invest in oil and to invest in the oil companies hit by covid 19 if no other energy source is found i will become super rich i did that 2 days ago by buying 2 calls on cpe callon petroleum and i already made a 30 return x200b for the moment i just invested in cpe because i felt like the shares were not expensive compared to the past when shares were valued more than 100$ but i plan on investing on other oil assets in the future x200b i regret not investing when cpe was 5$ but i think there is still a lot of potential for an upside trend x200b nb not a financial advice

95,34,2021-03-05 17:39:33,discussion about uwmc option open interest change on 342021 hi guys i want to preface that im all aboard the gme train and im not a bot i promise but i also fomoed into uwmc and need some confirmation bias haha anyway i wanted to have a discussion about the oi change in options on uwmc i usually download the changes in oi from barchart every day and look through to see if anything looks interesting and investigate further here is the excel filtered for uwmc now we cant be sure at all what the intent of the whales opening these positions are doing of course there are going to be covered calls and credit spreads in fact this might likely be the case because iv is pretty high for uwmc historically speaking however there are quite a bit of 31921 exp dates calls that were opened going from $10 strikes all the way up to $25 the oi on the 125c 15c are huge sitting at 55k and 70k respectively it seems like there is the potential here for a gamma squeeze once again im not an expert but if these are all calls that were buy to open then someone could be gearing up for a squeeze next week or the following week if they can get some momentum on the price to the upside this could be similar to what we saw with gme last week i think what would help is if someone had access to bloomberg and could see when these trades happened since we had a pretty wild day yesterday i think if we saw that the orders were placed at market open while the stock was jumping higher it would mean a lot different than if the orders were placed at the lows of the day my belief is that if the orders were more towards the end of the day it would be a higher chance of someone betting on a squeeze but i could be completely wrong anyway just wanted to get a discussion going with you guys im obviously bagholding here got about 500 shares at a price much higher than what its currently at dont take this as financial advice even though im not advocating anything except discussion

1215,315,2021-03-05 11:08:34,how to beat hedge fund algorithms on wsb a proposal hey guys so recently i was thinking hedge funds want to protect themselves from a future gme incident and have obviously developed algorithms to essentially parse through wsb and see what stocks are gaining momentum the problem is that its extremely easy to parse through reddit and find what post has a lot of upvotes and capture which stock ticker is mentioned so i was thinking why not make it more difficult for these bots potentially causing further headaches for these hedgies why dont we create a program that converts text to images that cant be parsed so easily kind of like a captcha system that bots cant easily win this will make it way more difficult to parse and we can get a time advantage as we know timing is essential here obviously its easy for hedge funds to hire actual people to search through wsb and find the next stock that gains momentum but that takes significantly more time there has to be a solution here too i just dont know what it is whatever the case i wont be surprised if hedge funds are hiring people right now to write the code to go through reddit to protect themselves lets at least give them a major headache edit sharing ideas on a forum shouldnt be illegal algos manipulating stock prices and hurting retail traders should be illegal i want to be able to share ideas to real humans and not bots designed to fuck us over thats all im saying edit 2 potentially we can use recaptcha something thats has been out for a long time google has developed this over many years before allowing access to any dd edit 3 i really like this suggestion by uthelegenddevil one way to beat them would be a browser plugin that changes your comment before posting to make all words that are close to being a ticker actually a ticker easy way to one way encode messages and humans should still be able to decipher what stock they were actually talking about
149,52,2021-03-05 08:23:19,ok listen up gme retards i realized something today tldr at the bottom make you atleast scroll through my work im not gonna pretend to be some sort of mathematician nor am i a financial advisor that you should listen to but my smooth brain does work sometimes so listen the fuck up the market has been absolutely taking a beating in recent weeks its a blood bath out there to say the least yet somehow gme is continuing to maintain andor rise above the market even on the bad days the market plummeting could be due to a number of reasons i personally believe that could be one of 2 things or even both 1 hedge funds selling off other portions of their portfolios to cover potential losses and keep gme price down long enough hoping people get bored and sell 2 all of us retards selling off our other stocks just to put it all right into gme i guess i could be wrong but the fact that gme is able to go positive on a miserable market day like today changed the whole game for me i dont care if you were here in december or if today is your first day whether you think gme is a massive squeeze prospect or a down the road long play now is the time to buy the time to sell is when you are happy with the gains i cant stand when dates are given lets be honest no one fucking knows what we do know is that this is likely about to be the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind i believe that both of those reasons listed above are why this is happening id love some input so drop it down below and maybe we can talk ape to ape tldr things are starting to line up and im gonna yolo the fuck out of gme til my nuts fall off as always do whatever the fuck you wanna do
18378,2318,2021-03-05 07:55:33,gme possibility of gamma squeeze just went through the roof as promised in the discussion thread i would post some updated info on what friday could bring in terms of itm options tldr the number of possible contracts itm could be double last weeks expiry over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball here is what i did pulled the option chain data into excel ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info what is a gamma squeeze for those who dont know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief eli5 gamma squeezes revolve around options i wont go into too much detail here on what those are but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers biggest of whom being option houses out of chicago they have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming itm in the money of course the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low these market makers thought gme was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds gme $15 goes to $150 market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge which of course will cause that price to rise more and more now that gme is $130 today was a great day gme closed up $817 or 658 maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for but on a down market day is pretty incredible now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait gme options exp 20210305 this friday gme $100 last fridays close option expiry at this level going into friday we could expect 22427 in open interest in itm gme contracts this week that sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised about 2242700 to be exact or about 497 of the total float crazy gme $130 we can expect 35989 contracts to be itm if tomorrow closes above $130 a solid 13562 more contracts than at the $100 level this equates to 3598900 shares or 797 of total float now were getting nutty what about gme $150 closing friday above this level brings thousands more contracts itm in fact closing above this price means there would be 46397 contracts itm this means that a whopping 4639700 shares or 1027 of total float more than double $100 what does this mean well not every contract will be exercised even itm these market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well but its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised 10 of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand it means more contracts will come itm next week and then more again the week after and so on with the steady price rise weve been seeing it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge could is operative and this is entirely speculation what we do know is that massive amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in gme theres been crazy volume at times particularly today the day before contract expiry any how ill put away my tinfoil hat what we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning the first dominos does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond no not really but it sure does increase the odds of that happening we probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves we all saw what happened with rh and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took its just the action that we were able to see summary since last friday 20210226 last option expiry the number of contracts possibly itm has doubled i repeat doubled if tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised 10 of total float will be called on even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close $130 there is still 50 more contracts itm than last week all of this continues to build that snowball thats started to get mighty big x200b ill say it again for those in the back doubled mic drop not financial advice this is just for fun any questions feel free to ask away

303,117,2021-03-08 21:20:48,shorters of gme and other stocks beware other perspective on dtcc ruling so we all know the new dtcc rule that they can force a broker to close a short position anytime they want we just dont know when this rule does come into effect if you think this will be used against hedge funds in the first place think again as good of news this might be for the price of gamestop right now for the future its a new rule against retail whose shorts will the dtcc force to close first melvins citadels some oder hfs or yours and mine exactly so to all those right now who swim against the current and risk their wsb lives by shorting gme now beware that youll be the first ones whose position will be closed before any hedgies this is imo another plan to try to minimize the losses those hedgies are about to take though for all the longs its probably christmas come early

578,117,2021-03-08 15:39:05,explaining gme synthetic long shares aka fake shares when melvin capital published news that they closed their gme short positions in january they likely manufactured synthetic long shares that mimic real gme shares aka manufacturing fake shares x200b tldr pricing to create synthetic long gme shares for friday march 5th gme shareprice $13774 synthetic long gme shareprice $3105 net credit naked put option manufacturing synthetic shares will deposit $3105 per share into the investors account but this cash is offset by high risk from naked put options that are mandatory to synthesize shares these synthetic shares wont show up in daily trading volume therefore an institution can manufacture 10 million or more synthetic shares without raising gmes shareprice x200b step by step how to a synthetic long share is manufactured by selling a naked put option for cash then using that cash to buy a call option at the same strike price and same expiry date combining the put and call together creates an investment that mimics the profit and loss of a real share actual march 5th pricing gme shareprice $13774 gme put $13500 expiry january 2023 $10605 credit gme call $13500 expiry january 2023 $7500 debit step 1 sell a naked put of gme $135 for $10605 per share credit aka cash step 2 buy a call of gme $135 for $7500 per share step 3 $10605 $7500 $3105 per share that is net credited cash in your hands to manufacture one gme synthetic long share the $3105 per share net credit is not free money because naked put options pay you to take risk detailed lesson on synthetic long stock by the options guide x200b potential gains and losses gme rises $100 from $135 to $235 gain $13105 per synthetic long share gme lowers $100 from $135 to $35 lose $6895 per synthetic long share real gme shares would gain or lose $100 per share in this scenario x200b pros cons manufacturing synthetic long shares wont affect shareprice and wont show up in daily trading volume synthetic shares earn profit or loss the same as a real share they can be hidden in multiple expiry dates and multiple strike prices to appear as many small investors instead of one large investor synthetic long shares are a high risk strategy due to naked put options being unpredictable they have an expiry date so the losses will be realized instead of being held in book value if the strategy fails x200b gme beyond $1000 x200b edit to add synthetic long shares do not cover short positions theyre only an accounting technique to make finances appear healthy i am in debt 50 million shorted shares but i own 50 million synthetic shares therefore i closed my short positions closed does not mean covered the hedge funds and shortsellers still owe the shortshares that they borrowed and they must buy real gme shares to cover their short positions the squeeze will happen x200b edit to add why would melvin capital manufacture synthetic long shares synthetic shares transfer debt to the writers of the call options now multiple call writers owe the 50 million shorted shares january instead of melvin capital by themselves the debt is spread across multiple institutions gme holders are creditors in this situation so the hedge funds treat us the same way that debtors treat a collections agency shareholders will be paid their $1000 per share the money will just come from many more sources than expected 
57,70,2021-03-08 13:18:00,utz brand dd am i doing this right hey guys im trying to learn how do to do proper dd and was wondering if you could tell me if im screwing it up i am a gme ape but actually want to learn how to do stocks right so a few weeks ago when i was doing dd for gme i was checking a bunch of stocks that were heavily shorted and utz was 55 shorted sorry no screenshots so i started doing research on the company and they just hit the market last year in august and has been doing well since so why was it shorted so much i for the most part just passively observed it for a bit fast forward to it today and it is shorted only 6 so i look at the stock and it dropped from 2589 to 2335 with 2m volume in 3 days and it is no longer shorted so now that the short is over i wondered if it is a good time to invest in it my money is tied up in gme but if i had funds available so i went to the call options to see what they had going on there and i found 7347 call options for $30 a share as well as 1092 $25 so i think this is not a guarantee but i think it would be a good safe investment with almost immediate returns plus there isnt too much risk because this company has been doing very well since it hit the market thanks fellow apes also gme rocket noises to the monkey noises moon
7357,639,2021-03-08 12:00:08,forbes article wtf am i a predator no im a momma bear who just wants to provide for her kids and splurge on herself once in a while is that too much to ask  tldr forbes can suck it this is my rant not financial advice ive reconsidered the forbes article that came out friday the more i think about it the more pissed ive become about the subtle manipulative and just plain evil condescension the writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers basically said the little gme investors were not just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray sounds good right well it was just another headfake yall the writer was framing us retail investors as the goliath not as the underdog as the david fighting against the goliath its disgusting these media shills including forbes are just spewing their own gme panic propaganda and all the so called experts that say retail investors are colluding together have lost their souls when corrupt leaders at big hedgies break the law and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollarswhen they actually collude to destroy companies and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profitguess what crickets nobody says or does anything about it not the media not the sec not the fbi not the dtcc an definitely not congress the only reason anyone is looking at it is because us regular people are now awake to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors they have to look like they are interested in holding somebody accountable but they arent really going after the hedgies they are going after you me dfv anyone who dares pull back the curtain but when regular people see a good opportunity and want to invest legally they lose their shit i dont know any of you i dont take advice from anyone here i read and research and then make my own decisions but dammit i see a good opportunity so ive jumped in the deep end of the pool ive jumped on the proverbial train and i will ride it to the end of the line im gonna be honest im just tired im tired of living on the edge of broke for years i just want to be able to finally get my kid braces to buy myself my good vehicle or at least fix the one we have it has 148k miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips i dont even like to drive across houston just in case the engine light goes on again my credit is not great so i cant finance a car dont say it ive already tried twice in 18 months every time i try again it tanks my credit further and since im self employed i dont have a job that pays me a regular paycheck therefore the your job is your credit financing isnt an option either so ya momma wants a car i want to take a family vacation hell i want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while i want to do fun things and important things like help my kids go to college if they want to i want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server or even provide a fabulous christmas for some family in need if this makes me a greedy bitch i guess im a greedy bitch but it doesnt make me a criminal it doesnt mean i am scheming to manipulate the stock market or that i am part of a premeditated predatory takedown of a cornered and defenseless counterparty as forbes claims ell we are the cornered defenseless counterparty not the multi billion dollar hedge funds are you friggin kidding me my shares and even all the shares we hold as retail investors do not have the power to move the market the big institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price we the reddit investors are just little ants on a log riding the roaring waters of the market hanging on for dear life and if we hang on then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride safe and dry we see the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money even maybe our lives to arrive at the end of that beautiful run who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along for playing their game the right way truth is these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands and they are the ones who have risked these peoples fortunes their very lives playing a rigged game their greed and corruption has been revealed and im sorry if they are freaking out but its just what happens when you get caught to be clear my goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds even tho i think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities i just want to ride the rapids to take the risk and get the payout i know is coming not because i know im so deserving but because i know the numbers dont lie thats not criminal its not even shady its smart i will end up in a calm peaceful lake surrounded by big beautiful mountains i will finally be able to enjoy the view i will send my kids to college buy those braces buy safe car and even go on a beautiful vacation and hey forbes hey cramer hey all you crooks investigating dfvlisten up thats not greedy its inevitable not financial advice do whatever the hell you wanna do i like the stock edit seriously tho we are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles no matter our color gender race religion or political ideology the real war is against evil and corruption for the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ephesians 612 kjv edit edit here is the link to the forbes article thank you all for making a momma feel seen and heard and for all the support i cant believe how this has blown up i woke up to over 200 more notifications and am trying to catch up on all the comments holy moly even tho it stings sort of funny some think im a shill nope just a regular momma who obviously doesnt know all the ins and outs to reddit my 16 yr old cant decide if hes proud or embarrassed his mom is using reddit now

3722,318,2021-03-08 10:52:46,it was inevitable that a video game stock would be the catalyst to change the way investing works forever first off i want to say that the following post is utter nonsense in fact i dont recommend reading it i may have eaten too many yellow crayons i thought were bananas this week or was i trying to eat yellow crayons but ate bananas idr but i think i stumbled onto something most people on this sub are millenials speculation most millenials grew up playing video games we have a passion for them but we never really picked up a lot of practical skills from playing video games until now as we all know robinhood and similar apps gameified investing they made cool colors to show us how we did its not enough to show green and red on the app so the entire fucking screen has to be colored so we know what the fuck is going on so we could say ohhhh green good red bad its like the slot machine except unlike slots investing odds can be changed by doing work nobody used to do the work but now that all the work is on the phonethe same device we have been using to play the gameit still feels like part of the game so we do some research and now we actually have a leg up in the game its like when you play starcraft and you suck but then you read an article on how to not suck at starcraft well we read posts on gme and we sucked less at predicting the movement on that stock why are video games even fun none of it is real but its a shared experience that you can have with your friends and peers or at the very least discuss with them its the consensus that something cool happened on a screen that makes games fun on a social level even though its all fake well none of the money movements we see on the screen are real sure its all documented but its still virtual nobodys going to your bank and moving cash into rhs bank this all works because we all agree that it works now get a bunch of apes to play the game after reading the rules and even for some of us practicing and youve got the beginning of a movement to a new era of trading and investing am i making any sense or am i insane even for a wsber edit wow guys thank you i have never received awards before i like rockets because i think they are food colored bananas

60,82,2021-03-08 06:55:09,dd dg dollar general poor folks love it obligatory not trying to distract from gme im in at $310 so please pick me up on the way to the moon long time lurker first time poster im retarded and my portfolio is red over the past year so do not listen to me this is not financial advice dollar general stock is down 20 over the last 6 months and barely up since the beginning of the pandemic but imo there is no reason for it they have beaten earnings and revenue projections the last 4 quarters the narrative is that they only beat because of the pandemic retail boost and it is not sustainable but we are going to be in the pandemic economy for a long long time dg stock is going to double in the next 2 years and let me tell you why these fuckers own the retail market for lower income folks my sister works at walmart headquarters in bentonville and there is literally a dollar general right next to her house they go head to head with walmart and dont give a fuck poor people fucking love dollar general they have brand recognition and brand loyalty go to bumfuck missouri sit outside a gas station and ask everyone who walks in which is cooler walmart or dg i guarantee 9 out of 10 will say dg they are beginning to experiment with their own brands this will go well imagine you can buy a case of beer and the cans just say beer on them who wouldnt fucking buy that this stimulus package is perfect for dg we are literally handing poor folks thousands of dollars right now plus the increased child tax credit will be hugely beneficial to dg customers do you understand how many children these people have and where do you think they are going to spend their stimulus checks they arent buying stocks or driving into the goddamn big city to shop at target or best buy they are taking those checks straight to dg and buying extra groceries beauty products alcohol lawn chairs electronics and more yes literally everything poor people need is sold at dg if inflation ever hits everyone is going to be shopping at dg its not like the current customers have a cheaper alternative to turn to if when inflation hits prices and not our paychecks more and more of us will be pushed to shop at dg dg stock is being held down because every granny with a checkbook is buying tech stocks right now but when that bubble finally bursts people will remember that its ok to own stock is companies that actually fucking make money dg is bubble proof and will benefit from the bubble bursting twofold people who lose in the bubble will be forced to buy dg stock as well as shop at dg for daily goods they are starting to dabble in tech and online shopping im not saying they are going to pivot to machine learning but they do have the data and consumer loyalty to suck more out of their market dg still sells tobacco and will own that market as larger corporations bow to pressure not to tell cigs maybe biden legalizes weed and dg starts selling marijuana loosies they are nimbler and more flexible than walmart target etc they are much much better at meeting local tastes you can buy locally sourced beef jerky at dg they will figure out ways to insert themselves into more and more markets analysts are nervous about their current weird ceo search pretty soon they will either announce a hot new hire or announce that they are keeping their current ceo with some hot new initiatives stock goes up either way tldr poor people love dollar general stock will double in the next 2 years i own jan 2023 calls at 240 and 250 i think the stock rises sooner than that but want them sweet sweet long term cap gains taxes

0,21,2021-03-07 14:39:46,$nvax is on sale with a whole lot of upside tldr nvax is a risky play but its fundamentals are shaping for a 35x upside in 2021 there is a lot of great $nvax dd out there on wsb already but here are some things i thought needed emphasis as to why nvax is a value play yeah you read that right $4 $175 and still a value play the upside 1 on their latest earning call they confirmed that theyre building production capacity to reach 2 billion doseyear by july 2021 nvax investor relations deck they have also confirmed that they are already producing the vaccine and by may expect to have production capacity of 150m dosesmonth this brings 2021 production to above 13 billion 2 their 2021 eps analyst estimates range between $26$29 per share analyst estimates at the current price of $175 this would mean a pe of 67x any which we you slice it thats a low multiple to put it mildly unless we expect eps to precipitously drop in 2022 and onwards nvaxs pe should level up to biotech pe levels of between 20 30x 3 they have shown outstanding efficacy against the original variant of 96 ie matching mrna pfebntx levels they have also shown great efficacy against the uk variant of 86 they have shown decent efficacy against south africa variant of 50 60 with hiv negative population all this with much simpler supply chain needs than mrna or pfe basically keeping it in a fridge 4 they also confirmed that they are running animal tests on other variants using both variant or bivalent approaches see the deck from point 1 above no other proven and efficacious supplier can match the latter as of now this could be a game changer ie taking 2 dose vaccines per year to deal with 2 or 3 covid variants plus their nanoflu vaccine x200b the downside 1 as was expected they announced some details of their tiered pricing although great for many in the developing world from revenue basis the ceo announced the price point that serum institute of india sii has with gavi is $3 per dose not clear if that is for all the 11 billion doses in their agreement with sii $nvax ceo interview x200b 2 final results from uk phase iii is still pending and with it any approvals from uk us authorities although the novavax exec leadership team sounds confident and their partners are playing ie investing massive capacity as though it is already a done deal we really need to see eua from the uk they are expecting this in early april and the us authorities towards the end of april but could go all the way to end juneearly july if fda asks to wait for us phase iii interim results for which are expected to come by end april and if uk is an indication final results could go all the way to june 3 the covid vaccine providers space is getting overcrowded fast saying nothing about other medicine being made available to treat the disease itself novavax needs to hold its own in this country and big pharma game this may mean that they need to either partner up with or get acquired by a larger pharma or sign lower price point deals with as many countries as possible 4 company insiders need to ease up on cashing out on their positions this is sending the wrong message to the market that a they have low confidence in the future value of the company or b they are tone deaf on the optics of making a killing from covid while many in the world are desperate because of it personally id rather any drop in price come from low price deals for wider distribution to people that desperately need it than these guys cashing out millions of $s as fast as they can 5 the executive leadership feels light on media presence listening to their earnings calls or other videos they comes across as genuinely good people but are playing things down why its like they are holding amazing hands but do not want to attract any attention possible reasons that i could come up with were a they dont want to sounds too pitchy b they want the science speak for the vaccine liability concern and c they are in partnership or acquisition talks and keeping things light and broad so as to not affect the negotiation i can get behind it if the reason was c but if it is a or even b i would like to remind them about what happened to tesla vs edison positions got out of a $135c position after interim uk phase iii results with 15x gains got out early yeah basically paper handed before the total meltdown from a $210p position with 3x gains holding on to 140 shares at an average price of $185 ps i am not a financial advisor i just like the stock and gme too to the moon
207,110,2021-03-07 14:36:32,was in the shower thinking about what i would do if i were in the shoes of melvin or other gme shorts so i got to thinking while i was in the shower of all places if i was in the absolutely fucked position of one of these short sellers what would i do knowing that my short position in gme is likely impossible get to out of without making my fund insolvent how would i move forward i came to the idea that i wouldnt try to stay solvent bare with me cause this was thinking out loud high on crayon dye if im the fund manager my plan would be first and foremost stave off and buy myself as much time as possible to delay a squeeze by whatever means necessary as we have seen play out over the last 4 weeks however buying time literally is really my side play and a diversion because my real focus is on trying quietly cash out the investors in my fund i know im fucked covering my short position is not an option so i say fuck it im sacrificing the fund i need to get my investors cashed out so im spreading fud and playing pmp and dmps to raise cash as well liquidatimg my other positions slowly and strategically i dont want to raise suspicions and i dont want to cause an outright sell off my plan is to liquidate the fund to cover myself and my investors not my short position let the fund go insolvent the fuck do i care if theres $500m left in the fund when the squeeze happens and i get margin called i dont really care ive covered myself and my investors take the fund the clearing house can eat it and so can the dtcc if im a fund manager i save myself and my investors and make it someone elses problem if the clearing house cant cover the dtcc will and more likely a government bailout just a thought what do you guys think i eat melted crayons behind arbys fyi

16,18,2021-03-07 06:02:16,question on selling a leap to buy weeklies tldr looking to make a probably stupid play with some gme during a gamma ramp up ahead of earnings insanity and asking for suggestions on how to better inform myself on how to properly evaluate the risk to reward i am pretty ignorant on the math of options i have 100 shares of a stock that i feel is going to take off in the next couple of weeks i would like more stock but i have no more available capital i was looking at january 2022 bids on otm calls and they are right about in line with my share cost for a strike price that is at the minimum price i would be willing to sell my shares i started thinking about selling that call and tossing that money into some moderately far otm weeklies my thought is that i can leverage the upward pressure into more profit than just holding my shares can deliver the problem i see right off the bat is that i lose the option to sell my shares until january if share prices place that far off otm deep in the money the potential of the buyer of that call not exercising while itm could cause me to lose the opportunity to profit from the sale at strike price sure i will probably get those shares back or at get paid the strike price at some point now my hope is that the same price pressure getting us up to the strike price of my sold call will translate to even bigger profits from my shorter dated calls at lower strike price and yet my weak understanding of options and an underlying sense of danger makes me hesitant to take such a position i dont need my initial investment back this year and if share prices go down i can always buy back the option for less that i was paid if i dont spend the entire sum on shorter dated otm calls anyone willing to help me out with some direction on where to find resources for evaluating such a move
11,8,2021-03-07 05:36:51,gme last week a theory my opinion up for discussion this post seems to indicate approx 5 million shares were required by mm to hedge at the end of last week then we saw a week of quiet low volume trading leading paper hands traders to lower their profit expectations and set lower limit sell order then thursdays big spike happened and the full 5 million shares got bought with only a big picture minimal increase in share price then when it became clear that gme was not going to break $150 they could offload a bunch of those shares driving the price down at the end of the day after a quiet week with low volume minimal large swings paper handers sold out on the cheap preventing a gamma squeeze tldr the paper handers need to demand more profit when they collectively liquidate 5 million shares getting bored and setting close to market limit sell orders leaves a lot of money on the table

3,32,2021-03-06 22:28:03,the way  the key to the gamma squeeze is this call options are a much cheaper way to apply the pressure on the shorts in this example the option costs just 2 of the cost of buying a full share of tesla this tilts the game dramatically in favor of the orchestrators of the squeeze with just 2 of atrisk investment they can force the shorts to take on $100 of new risk even with the shorts liquidity advantage this is now a different battle it opens the game up to the retail swarms that mobilized around gme on reddit they targeted the huge exposed short positions in gamestop well over 100 of the companys outstanding float where before it required major financial muscle to even attempt a corner or a short squeeze now huge numbers of small traders can join the game the tipping point is quickly overrun the shorts were forced to cover
59,122,2021-03-06 21:16:05,gme and rkt are far from over tldr gme 420 if we diamond hands and buy rkt 69 pt if we can not fight over it being shorted too so gme is the large ape in this shortwar algorithmits got a lot of capacity to climb it held through a red market better than i expected and it isnt going away we know where this is goingjust not sure on when so we gotta stay strapped in and wait for the countdown and sirens to start randomly im hoping rocket isnt a one time shot because you know they doubled down on the short after the first burstlast i checked it still had weight behind it but interest waned a little the dividend is out now and i didnt realize it affected the price of my options significantly lowering their strike price for me not sure the strategy going forward besides reconsolidation of focus towards it being able to hit over 60 if it spikes at current its at fmv fair market value and is a solid company as well so it wont plummet at this point so its a great reentry and if you bought the dip on friday thats as low as i see it going from here on outi hope i like the stock rkt to the moon ape know rockets good 
161,21,2021-03-06 16:53:11,count of gold given to dfv double down post because i couldnt resist getting a figure for how much money was spent on all this gold here with the help of regex parsing reddits html from the pop up screen where you can buy coins and dfvs post i was able to create a map from award to cost and quantity information on how many of each award was given luckily even though the icon award links and purchase links arent identical the only difference was the size parameters so they could be programmatically matched by finding the longest prefix there are 116 unique award types of those 106 have been awarded on that post for every award coin cost amount this is how many awards were given 20 112 30 245 50 561 70 21 75 221 80 2864 100 3073 125 2759 150 2850 200 84 250 115 300 60 325 190 350 6 400 34 500 311 1000 42 1800 51 2000 9 5000 2 10000 1 20000 4 40000 2 50000 5 the total sum being 2242780 coins for the lease value 500 coins can be bought for $2 which would make this cost $897112 the best value if you can call it that is 82k coins for $200 which would make this cost $547020 the legendary post was made on february 19th when the price per share of gme closed at $4059 meaning that this money could have gone towards 134 shares in the case of the best value
153,42,2021-03-06 14:45:09,gme crashing the market you say already happened four times last year  remember how we all joke about gme crashing the market ha ha ha yea thats crazy well to a certain degree this has already happened multiple times but not to the extent were seeing now there are four times during 2020 where gme share prices spiked more than 20 and each time they were followed by the market dipping x200b below ive overlaid the spy and gme starting back at february 2020 the white arrows are to draw your eye to points where gme price rose while the economy fell the first arrow draws attention to how gme remained nearly constant while the rest of the market fell 30 june 5th gme goes from $4$550 next mondaytuesday sees the market fall aug 28th gme goes 5$30$700 $8 start of the next week and by friday we see the market sell off sept 16th gme goes from $700 $900 and market falls for the rest of september oct 8th gme goes from $920 $1400 and the market doesnt dig back out until nov 5th remeber when shorting gme tanked the market oh which time x200b is this some weird ass thing about those dips and retail or shops in the mall so lets see if walmart and victorias secret compare and show similar spikes like gme before market dips my reasoning for this walmart is large retail chain maybe it involves something with shopping victorias secret because theres almost always one located a few shops down from the gamestop in the mall comparing walmart and victorias secret to spy soooooo nope nothing too obvious like gamestop maybe sorta something with walmart around september but nothing really sustained though soooooo yea its kinda fucked thats its already happened multiple times in the past and were seeing it again and no one mentions anything except how retail investors are increasing volatility and driving up random stocks that cnbc wants to push would love to see how this compares to other companies in 2020 that were also as shorted but i dont know which ones had consistantly high short interest for the majority of the year tldr hedgies already have significantly fucked the market at least 4 times with shorts on gme the markets overall trend changed right around when gme started soaring notice the cresting and rounding of the top around mid january almost certainly due to hfs shorting compare the two for yourself gme peaks and markets fall a few days after
80,57,2021-03-06 12:49:10,if the 2008 squeeze happened for gme ive been seeing the whole 100k or bust thing going around for gme and wanted to see if there was any sort of realistic basis for it while i personally still think this is genuinely a meme i wanted to see what a theoretical priceshare would be if a moass event pushed gme to be one the worlds most valuable companies for a moment just as with the 2008 volkswagen short squeeze this is all just fun speculation assuming a scenario where a supersqueeze gave gme enough momentum to make it the most valuable company in the world for a moment similar to the 2008 squeeze x200b makes me understand maybe where the whole 100kshare thing originated from this is not financial advice no one really knows whats in store for gme in the next few weeksmonths
17,15,2021-03-06 12:28:52,a picture worth 1383 words so im new to apelike trading but the boomer style investing is boring and also i hear theres a bubble which will be bad for that style my question is is it normal for somewhat random stocks and the market in general to be this similar in patterning theyre all doing basically the same thing at the same time and its pretty much the inverse of gme its weird is this normal yes this was taken on my rh account i put in a transfer to fidelity a while ago but its been delayed 3 times they currently claim its going to happen on 38 but i have my doubts also 90 of my money thats in the market including 80 shares of gme is on vanguard but i try not to ape with that money too much to the moon g

1385,317,2021-03-06 10:24:13,gme recap and dd explaining why you can demand what ever price you want for gme this is the simplest but best explanation as to why it can go up to whatever the retail shareholders want but simple enough for you smooth brains to understand credit to thehoustonwade on twitter 1 people talked about $gme a whole bunch in january but i dont think you realize just what is happening in the market and how this one stock could result in the greatest transfer of wealth in human history so i give you this thread why is gamestop a game changer 2 it all begins with the fact retail is dying people buy things online games now have downloadable content and you dont need to by disks or cartridges any more so people dont visit the store as often the storefronts are tired and 20 years old and profits were spent on buying back 30$ of its stick to keep the price from dropping so much they get delisted they went from 100 million shares to 70 million shares 20 million of which are owned by insiders and cant be freely traded then about 35 million of the remaining 50 million shares are owned by big investment and index funds while the remaining 15 million shares are owned by retail investors average folk like you and me who are too poor to be invited by a hedge fund but put these shares in our meager portfolios or 401k 3 it is important that you remember that there are only 50 million shares that can trade now to stay afloat gamestop issued some bonds and the first big set of bonds imagine as of they took out a multimillion mortgage on their entire business scheduled to mature do so in the next week or so 4 sometime last year some shit ass hedge fund bros saw $gme struggling then got hit by the pandemic and decided it was time to short the shot out of the stock and become kajillionaires they borrowed the stock millions of shares of it from the index funds and then sold it expecting the price to crater and then scooping up the cheap shares and giving them back to the people they borrowed them from if $gme were to bankrupt then they wouldnt even need to give back the shares or even declare capital gains billions in profit tax free 5 so fully expecting gamestop to default on their bonds they shorted and they borrowed more and they shorted and they borrowed some more and they shorted but who was buying the shares regular dorks like us retail investors were buying and hoarding the stock 6 by january the shares on gamestop had been shorted something like 140 how does that happen well once the stock is borrowed and shorted and someone like me buys the shares i would get counted as an owner and the fund from which the shares were borrowed gets counted as an owner too then the stock sits in my brokerage account and my broker lends the stock to a hedge fund and shorts it again so someone else bought the shares and theyre counted as an owner im counted as an owner and the index fund is counted as an owner before long this had gotten out of control and the index funds wanted their shares back but the price of the stock had risen above what the hfs had shorted it for and the retail owners refused to sell this is called a short squeeze and the result was the stock going from $257 to $480 in a year 7 it wasnt that $gme generated business that warranted such a high price but the fact that the hfs got out over their skis and their greed hoisted their petar 11 hedge funds went bankrupt and the biggest melvin capital was down 53 the stock fell and bottomed out around $40 a share but it wasnt done more hfs loans were due and they had had buy the stock and give it back to their lenders so the price spiked again last week to around $200 this caused a new problem options markets 8 options markets are weird to the average person basically people have the stock in 100 share blocks and sell options to buy known as call options where you purchase the right to buy the stock at at a set price of the market for that stock goes up for example an options writer makes an out of the money otm option for $gme back at christmas for $80 a share that has a date of february 26th this means if someone buys that option at like $1 a share for 100 shares and by february 26th the stock is more than $80 they can exercise that option and get all $100 shares for below market value at $80 a share the options writer must sell them those shares or else 9 well when a stock is trading at $20 and the options writer sells an $80 option the dont actually own the shares because who expects a shitty stock like $gme to shoot up 300 this is called a naked option and the options trader now has to find the shares to fulfill the order the problem is that he only got paid $81 per share and last friday shares were $100 each so the options guys are hemorrhaging money because the stock went from $40 to $100 in three days and all the contracts due on 226 from $100 on down were now in the money itm 10 on top of this a whole bunch of short sellers were doing naked shorts meaning they were selling stock they didnt have on the promise that in two days they will find the shares and deliver them betting that the price would drop and they could find cheap shares to fulfill their order as it stands between the shorts naked shorts and naked call options the rich douchebags have to find something in the neighborhood of 200 million to 500 million shares to fill their orders there are only 50 million physical shares in existence all now in the hands of retailer investors who are refusing to sell and millions more naked shares from call options will be itm come tomorrow afternoon if the price remains above $100 11 every evening after the market closes the brokerages do some accounting with the clearing houses they even their books see that xnumber of shares moved here and ydollars moved there and sometimes they find that 3 million shares are supposed to move from a hedge fund account with brokerage a to accounts with brokerage b but the hf account with brokerage a only has 2 million physical shares to give this is known as a failure to deliver ftd so brokerage a looks at their other accounts and sees that there are another million shares owned by their customers and loans these 1 mil shares to the hedge fund to give to brokerage b and as hedge fund account has 21 days to find 1 million more shares or else 12 this or else is big because if 21 days pass and the hedgefund hasnt found the shares brokerage a is required to liquidate the hedge funds assets and buy the stock at any price to fulfill their obligation if the retail investors demand $1 million a share then brokerage a has to pay $1 million a share and liquidate $1 million of the hedge funds assets to pay for it the same goes for the options writers if they go 21 days from when they sold the shares and dont deliver they now have to liquidate assets and pay any price for these shares and they all have to do this hundreds of millions of times because remember there are 200 to 500 million nakedsynthetics shares out there but only 50 million physical shares they dont know of they will get a physical share or a synthetic one when someone offers to sell and they have to keep buying until all orders are filled 13 hedge funds and entire options markets will go bankrupt if there are 500 million shares shares bought at $100000 each then these groups have to come up with $50 trillion no one has that kind of money so they will be liquidated pit of existence and then the insurance companies and the clearing house themselves will have to start buying shares with their $63 trillion insurance fund which is basically just the federal reserve printing money 14 the entire global economy is only $878 trillion and for a brief few days $gme has the power to not only be a $7 trillion company making ryan cohen possibly the worlds first trillionaire but to essentially see almost all the cash on earth go to fulfilling a whole bunch of shitty bets a bunch of douchebros made filter into the hands of poor schlubs from reddit who called their bluff something like 63 multibillion hedge funds could face annihilation it takes $1 million in liquidity and a yearly salary of $200k or more to invest in most hfs much of the 1 is about to lose all their wealth to a bunch of pottymouthed degenerates from internet message boards and the fear is palpable thus potentially the greatest transfer of wealth in human history is but days or weeks away edit this is where i look at the short interest edit very important this is not financial advice i am not telling anyone to invest in gme or to spend any money in anything whatsoever this is 100 my opinion with research edit i am holding a lot of gme shares but lets be honest wsb has turned into an echo chamber with either a bunch of shills discouraging us or a bunch of apes just blindly following into bankruptcy so please do your own research dont just skip over dd understand it and make an informed decision edit someone else mentioned on another sub that cohen owns several million shares and that the dtcc is insured for 65 trillion dollars edit thank you guys for all the awards and fuck you 3 edit to all the people talking about the fedthe powers that be im well aware this all theoretical tldr most of bananas are owned already big monkeys need to cover bananas they borrowed if we the small but many apes dont sell the demand goes up but supply is practically nonexistent longer we hold bananas more price goes up until lil apes choose to sell
517,108,2021-03-06 10:05:10,gamma squeeze may be coming next week gme technical analysis from a retard not financial advice so here we can see a double bottom blue balls pattern meaning one bottom higher than the other just like a ball sack this pattern is more bullish than the standard double bottom as it means buyers stepped in to push the stock up before it even reached the last level of support indicating strong buying power i predicted this to happen on monday but it ended up taking the whole week to retest resistance which could actually imply a stronger squeeze is on the horizon why does it matter that gme is following patterns and trend lines and not just going full retard mode well let me break it down gme is in the process of fuelling up to go full retard mode the last time gme was behaving like a normal stock was back in january before the first squeeze when the stock was trading between $10$30 gmes more normal price action this week shows that it has reached a stage of fair valuation we are back in that $10$30 time period except for the price being 10x bigger ive read through other sources that gmes fair valuation is actually around $12401 which makes sense for the decrease in volatility now it has found its fair valuation 5 green daily candles in a row signifying a push above resistance completing cup handle pattern gme closed above $130 today which means there are thousands of $100 $130 call options itm these options could be exercised and cause a gamma squeeze thus completing the cup handle pattern or they could be settled for cash which means the call writer dumps the shares on the market and passes the profit onto the contract holder if a shitload of partiallycompletely naked itm calls which are rare most call sellers will own all the underlying by the time it reaches the strike and delta gets to like 9 are exercised and not settled theyll have to buy the underlying to deliver as per the contract which they can take a long ass time to do if they decide to yolo cover their calls all at once the price may go up which will cause unexpired otm calls to move itm which may then cause a gamma squeeze bare in mind this is not the short squeeze this will happen when hedge funds cover their naked shorts pushing the price way past 5 figures tldr buy the dips hold sit back relax if you see the stock pushing up next week it is most likely not the short squeeze not just yet i am just a retard expressing his views with crayons who drew lines and shapes on a chart this is not financial advice
22,10,2021-03-06 09:49:07,why naked shorting isnt needed to fuck the system lets say i have a company with 1 share fred borrows it from me and sells them to chad the float is now 200 boom no naked shorting needed say another wants to short he borrows it from chad sells it to sally float is now 300 so why everything is actually fucked so many people have bought calls that it would be impossible to deliver shares to everyone if the price spikes and theres no requirement when selling calls that you must hold the shares that need to be delivered if the price gets high enough shit is going to hit the fan and hard but theres naked shorting yes there is the market makers do that to ensure they can actually deliver against your promise say you sell a put to a market maker how does he make sure he doesnt get reamed he shorts shares to remain delta neutral how does the market maker handle a call he buys shares since market makers are needed as an intermediary for you to gamble away your life savings its 100 legal for them to do whatever they need to manage risk on their book including shorting shares that dont exist but this isnt the structural issue with gme tldr you dont need naked short selling to blow up the system just enough dumb apes buying call options for shares that dont exist
48,12,2021-03-06 09:29:17,january increase vs february the rocket is near  hello everyone ive updated the chart from some dd posted by ucuttingwater_ i wanted to highlight what i thought was very important the stock increases the increase is so similar to what happened during the last gamma squeeze in january x200b were currently on day 15 or march 5 of course you could bet a thousand other factors to happen during monday but im willing to bet oh yes an option call that next week is going to be very interesting x200b but then again i know nothing i see gme i buy i see gme graphy number i buy this is not financial advice obligatory

115,55,2021-03-06 06:47:05,td ameritrade restricted opening of fds today on gme and rkt i switched from rh to td ameritrade thinking that they wouldnt subject me to the same trading restriction bullshit that rh did to a certain extent thats true it hasnt been as bad as rh but they are still nickel and diming me with restricting selling covered calls on volatile stocks and today they restricted opening 0dte options on gme and rkt cant do it on tos cant do it over the phone totally shut down a week ago when the iv on gme was higher they had no problem with people doing so i called tda up to ask for an explanation the broker said all the info they had on why the restrictions were put in place was because volatility and that the decision came from high up the ladder with no explanation my investment on these tickers is speculative in nature and depends on the idea that a fair and open market exists all the time to exploit inefficiencies in said market id like to take my business elsewhere to a broker that has large enough aum to withstand capital requirement pressure from clearinghouses has a reputation for allowing unrestricted trading on volatile tickers and has a solid trading interface a la tos are there any brokers out there that fit that description
117,108,2021-03-06 06:08:25,how not to pay tax on your tendies uk  right listen up retards ive been talking isas a bit here today and the amount of people that dont know they could be using them is worrying so youre not a smart ape and the fact you might actually make a profit has taken you by surprise right youre using some hack broker like etoro or trading212 because they offer cfds but now youve bought shares what does that matter mr hilla well my little spazzy friend put simply tax you can buy shares in an isa but that means using a slightly more serious broker in most cases thats going to stick their hand into your tendie bag before and take some fees you know what an isa is right its an individual savings account youve probably heard of it because your dad started one a cash isa because hes as dumb as you and doesnt realise his shitty savings pile is way too small to pay any tax on the interest anyway thats the point you dont pay tax on the interest or gains made in an isa but you can only have one of each type and you can only put 20000 into it a year im going to make more than 20k here sir this is useless well get to that isas come in another form too several but only one is important for now a stocks and shares isa that means you can invest inyouve guessed it stonks like gme for example if youve got 14 at $100 shares in etoro or 212 you close at $100k you make yourself a cool mil and hit the withdraw button brilliant youre a millionaire congratulations you run downstairs as the tear gas canisters come raining through the window you head for the back door and boris johnson falcon punches you in the sternum he reaches into your pocket and he makes off with almost 200k in capital gains tax because he hasnt given his mates any money for ppe that doesnt exist for a few weeks youre on the floor gasping for air and crying because youre no longer a millionaire that didnt last long did it lets backtrack and assume you dont want hancock back door shuffling your tendies back to his 1 pals the isa well as i said you dont have to pay tax on any gains made in an isa it doesnt matter if you put a thousand in and made a million made 2 million 3 millions all those gains are tax free leave them in take them out doesnt matter youre not paying tax on it so you put your gme shares into an isa and the taxman isnt getting a penny of it until you spend it at the audi dealership if your broker is horsesht and they probably are they wont transfer your shares i bought more in an isa i was going to sell my shares on etoro and buy more in my isa but the hedgies arent getting their hands on my shares so i added the same amount of shares in my isa anyway ill use the etoro shares to cover the initial investment balls deep in this mofo if your broker isnt horsesht and offers a share dealing account and an isa they should be able to transfer them and you want that sooner rather than later however you want it done quickly you dont want time out of the market else you miss your ticket to the moon even fucking freetrade can do it edit apparently freetrade wont do it some like fidelity will take care of it all when you contact them and say you want your investment with them who can do it for me fidelity edit apparently not fidelity either hargreaves landsdown are a safe bet expensive at 12 per transaction aj bell are cheaper but less stocks freetrade small monthly fee but dont have their own clearing house and you might get hit with restrictions like last time ig top tier scumbags but cheap and have the biggest selection of stocks restricted gme last time claimed it was to reduce server load because they kept crashing there are more not an exhaustive list then once youve got your profits you can go back to paying tax like the smooth brain that you are me im putting it in my spread betting account where i still wont pay tax on my gains

210,52,2021-03-10 20:40:56,this is why gamestop wont stop and why $100k is not a meme first lets look at the players involved here the shorts on the short side we have some hedge funds most notably melvin and citadel who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain the market makers may have some overlap with the shorts marker makers write options contracts to be allowed to buy call or sell put shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date they collect a fee for selling those contracts but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless because then they get to keep their fee and dont need to keep their contract because it wasnt in the money how does this work well for example when gme was trading around $40 they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so never expecting the price of gme to even reach anywhere near $800 so the fools who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls or so they thought more on this later the longs on the long side we have you glorious apes cohen and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on melvin and other shorts especially if they can make some money while doing so now lets look at the actions that have led up to this it all started when the shorts were getting greedy and with covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster they did not expect gamestop would survive covid and they did everything in their power to make it so shorting the company to the ground with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and taxfree profit its important to point out that they could have covered at $3$4 but did not if they did not cover at $3 or $4 what makes you think they covered at $40$400 hint they didnt in fact they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400 was just a gamma squeeze in other words they have not even begun to cover yet then some people liked the stock some people have calculated that the real short interest in somewhere between 250 and 967 something like 200 million to 500 million shares short some people may think this is insane but if you do the math you will see that no matter what finra says its impossible for short interest to be below 200 and its more likely to be around 500600 its hard to find reliable data but if you just look at the volume and price action its obvious that the shorts have only increased since january 28th not decreased it is mathematically impossable for the shorts to have covered it simply doesnt add up how the gamma squeeze will trigger the short squeeze some people doubt this could reach $10k or even $100k just as people doubted it could reach $1000s but here is why those numbers are not only likely but mathematically inevitable im not an expert to so take it fwiw feel free to call me an idiot but if im right ill expect apologies first lets look at the option interest source x200b strikeopen interest march 12thopen interest

price hits strike price when the mms sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40 they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that gme would hit $800 by march 12th however now that chance is approaching 1 and climbing the mms still dont need to cover fully but they are starting to consider the chance of it happening is becoming more and more likely so for each option remember each option is 100 shares they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1 chance of it happening but this very act may cause it to happen at some point this is a selffulfilling prophecy because mms are insuring their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up the price actually goes up which means they need to insure even more which creates a snowball effect all the way up to or beyond the last option which is at strike price $800 similarly the mms probably considered it about maybe 5 likely that gme would hit 300 this week but now its more like 95 like which means for each option contract with strike 300 they will be buying 90 shares before the price hits 300 which means about a million shares bought which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place they do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in after the price reached past 300 then they will definitly make a loss at least if they buy in before the price reaches $300 they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses remember all parties are trying to make money but not all of them succeed so mms are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days and looking at the above table this will likely push the price towards and likely over $800 either this week or next week you can also see in some particular numbers theres a lot of shares that need to be covered expect a lot of action when we approach those numbers for example $300 $350 $400 $420 $500 and of course $800 as you can see some of those numbers are close and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point this is only the gamma squeeze now what about the short squeeze some people ask why dont the shorts just wait for the rally to be over and buy when the price drops back to normal levels simple answer they cant melvin was already down 53 the last time and they didnt even cover that was just a gamma squeeze by their own words when a hedge fund has a short position they can keep that position as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves if the price of the asset they are short increases drastically like in the event of a gamma squeeze they will be forced to buy as an example lets say hedge fund m has $100 billion worth of assets and shorts company g for $1 billion at $10 per share now the price goes to $1000 per share so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts this is an unacceptable risk as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover so they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted however this very act will drive up the price if you want to know how read up on order books and slippage this post is getting long enough as it is in fact this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy but seeing as melvin managed to lose 53 and still didnt cover it seems likely melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses and will actually go bankrupt this will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses the clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble im pretty sure thats illegal so the clearing houses would cover immediatly regardless of costs even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air so tldr its a short squeeze because the shorts are forced to buy back their shorts one way or another since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares while only about 50 million or fewer are available this will be name your price kind of prices this is where $100k is not a meme important last point dont lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future remember it doesnt cost us anything to hodl but it does cost them a lot to short every day they are losing millions every day we keep the price above $0 is a win for us
37,33,2021-03-10 20:27:39,my humble and amateur prediction for gme in coming days or so edit this isnt a prediction for the potential sp but more short term events as gme continues to rise day after day we creep closer and closer to the alltime high of $483 heading into the high 200s new buyers need to make sure they are willing to lose what they are risking since approaching the $483 mark means a lot of people will be getting ready to sell their hands which were bought above $300 especially above $400 basically a lot of people currently deep in the red are going to be keen to just abort mission and recover mostall the money they lost theres going to be a lot of people who thought they had made the worst trade in their life and any sort of way out will be snatched up immediately given the sp 1 is high enough to offer a decent enough percentage of their loss returned to them and 2 appears to hit any sort of peakresistance once over the $300 mark i believe the sp will creep towards the $300 and start to encounter a lot of resistance i see the possibility of a $350 peak before a very abrupt downfall as people in the red see their chances of escape fading so they cut their losses this sudden increase in sellers will make recent buyers since late feb surge sense danger anybody who was lucky enough to buy sub 100 through feb will likely see an end to their run and will bail with generous profits that also includes anybody who bought over $100 who fear their gains may suddenly turn into losses this will cause the sp to plummet suddenly before a huge amount of buyers jump in believing they have now managed to enter in at bargain price this will cause another spike and will likely bring a lot of sellers back into the mix who sold out of fear causing the sp to rise very suddenly once again before slowing back down heading towards the predicted judgement day march 19th who knows what will happen then so what should you do if you are thinking of buying in be ready for some chaos and be ready to lose what you are risking that should always go without saying if you have bought already be prepared to hold throughout the initial dip that i believe will come soon selling during the dip will only add fuel to the fire and youll be rewarded if you stay good luck
112,26,2021-03-10 19:31:52,fungibility a critical concept that you need to understand $5000 gme is a breeze bomo $5000 price per share is roughly 385b market cap thats like 18 of what apple is fungibility stock prices are fungible meaning it only takes 1 trade between you and me to increase the market cap by billions heres an example lets say apple is trading at $120 and the market cap is 207t i want to buy 1 share and all of the sudden your the only person in the entire market willing to sell but you want $125 for it and so if i buy that 1 share valued at $125 that 1 transaction adds 85b in market cap making the new market cap 215 t a transactional trade value of $125 for 1 share resulted in a 85b bump in market cap this is fungibility this is how its possible if theres 12 million shares short the only way we get to valhalla is via shorts covering in order to do so you must not freak out and settle for a quick flip thinking to yourself ill buy back in because guess what that first time you sold was a short covering and now theyre out of the gme so whos going to bid the price up now you me our goal is to take from the hedgies not each other who am i kidding we all know there will be plenty of us retards buying at these prices because the fomo is real however this is bomo buy or miss out 
46,25,2021-03-10 06:49:28,some $unfi bull analysis not financial advice i am literally a gorilla ok unfi is the biggest food wholesaler in the us theyre currently at $3097share earnings tomorrow am back in 2015 they peaked at $8304 then they nose dived because $amzn bought whole foods $wfd and everyone thought amazon was going to replace unfi and selfsupply weellll turns out food logistics is pretty fucking complicated whole foods has used unfi as their primary distributor for years and extended their contract with unfi last week through 2027 the other reason the stock was beat down was that $unfi bought supervalu grocery chain which came with some baggage mainly union pension requirements im taking from domo capitals seeking alpha a little bit but from 201418 supervalu traded at avg 7 evebitda and unfi traded at avg 11 evebitda and somehow when unfi buys supervalu they go down to a 578 evebitda most mergers increase stock price but what do i know im actually a gorilla grocery revenues continue to be up from the pandemic so an earnings beat tomorrow is likely on top of that 85 of outstanding unfi shares are owned by institutions and its heavily shorted float 51210000 shares shorted 12280000 shares that arent insiderinstitutionally owned 6298830 i dont want to pull from the gme rally but maybe a good place to put your moonrocks when youre ready i bought $5400 of jan 2022 $45 calls yesterday hoping to help bring organic frozen tendies to the apes edit if unfi sells any more real estate to pay down its debt like it did in 2020 i think theres a good chance it hits $60 in the next 12 months

56,35,2021-03-10 05:58:31,why brokers are not accepting limit orders at prices far above last traded price after moving from rh i was getting frustrated that tda and other brokers wouldnt let me place set it and forget it limit orders for gme at really high prices i only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest i called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone no dice the explanation they gave me was that it is not their call it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price the broker claimed that the mms have finite bandwidth on their order books so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price since the mms dont think that its possible for the price to moon that quick so theres no chance of ever being filled they dont allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled which lol then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0dte options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week i did test this to see if it was true both ways i tried to place a limit buy for gme on tda at $1 price and it rejected that for being too far from market price does anybody know the mechanics of how mm order books and fills work to confirm whether this bandwidth claim is legit
141,13,2021-03-10 02:40:39,amazing apes why wsb unironically gives me hope for the future i dont need to recap how shitadel and vlad conspired to fuck you all over by restricting trading but i will talk about their reasoning why do something so blatant that it pisses off your customers and grabs the attention of congress you see as attention spans grow shorter and shorter pr consists more and more of just distracting people for a tiny amount of time if you can ride out a pr crisis for a few days youre in the clear theres always some other bullshit to pay attention to so they bet their app and their reputations on this if they could distract wsb for a few days everyone would forget about gme sure some devoted apes would be on here throwing their turds around but the power of the masses would be dissipated never to return ironically its you retards who proved conventional wisdom wrong they threw everything they had at you and you stayed focused and strong they tried precious metals an artificial dip and constant negative media attention but you all kept your eyes on the golden banana you showed that millions of apes together cannot be distracted or dissuaded from their goal heres looking at you apes

382,31,2021-03-09 23:08:33,for the first time since i invested in gme im actually starting to make some money from it  i bought my first share of gme on january 29th for $31918 it went up maybe 5 dollars after that and then it all crashed i bought a few more shares as it went down but i was honestly wondering if id made a huge mistake and just wasted my money on a dumb meme i got my average cost down to $18114 and i was planning on getting a few more shares later since i didnt think it would be moving from the $40s any time soon i was wrong and i was honestly shocked to see the price quadruple in the past two weeks it was a surprise to be sure but a welcome one i havent made the hundreds of thousands of dollars that some people on here have and i still dont think gme will get me anywhere near that much but for someone who has never made more than $10 an hour any free money is more than welcome i cant wait to see where things end up by the end of this week gme to the moon baby 
254,28,2021-03-09 07:12:46,my love letter to the retards i am almost certain that this will get lost in new in amongst the sea of dd and gain porn that will inevitably be posted this evening and i guess that is ok i just wanted to thank you all from the bottom of my hearts i had been following this sub for a few months before it got all of its recent traction and i am not afraid to say that gme was the first time i was ever bold enough to invest now being the retarded ape that i am i somehow managed to invest at 240 on the major come down and subsequently managed to drag my a average price per share down to 179 this was over a month ago and i had to endure the horrendous weeks of everyone telling me how fucking stupid i was for wasting the small amount of money i had on this stupid stock while i was prepared to lose the money i had invested i wont lie being down 83 felt pretty shit well today it turned around for the first time since buying the stock i have closed the day in the green you guys stuck with it through all of the shit and humiliation and finally we are seeing the rewards we deserve this army of apes might just be the greatest thing reddit has ever produced and i could not be prouder to be holding my 7 damn shares apes together strong 
1047,159,2021-03-09 06:24:36,this is a hedge fund insider report that was made a month ago in early february after the first gamma squeeze continue to stick together buy and hodl make of this what you will original post by by ohiodiver29 edit this is not financial advice as you can see most of things going on with gme right now are just msm being paid to lure normies into selling their positions for background i work in one of the major finance companies not on finance but with machine learningtime series prediction but ive lots of meetings with lots of people and people talk i cant give away too much info because it may cost my job but the deep shit going on is over the charts in 100 years this event will be spoken of first of all not all hedge funds shorted gme this is important because of what is about to happen some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans im speaking of exorbitant amounts remember that 35 of the dollars ever printed were printed last year guess who is going to get a big piece of that why they want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium wsb opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others maybe people here didnt realize yet what they started but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now second big hedge funds are partnering up but this is where comes the problem imagine that you will try to rob a bank what make you sure that the people that you partner with wont kill you to have less people to share the money with this is the current situation this is the waiting hedge funds including the company that i work with are waiting for the money and to see who they can trust in the end they will all backstab each other this is the finance industry you cant deny it because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short yes the hedge funds all over again but is far easier to short at 750$ so is just a matter of who will short first at work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it that was what created this opportunity but some people never learn this is why you should hold im holding just for fun and to see this shit show if one day i sell i will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall we are living the ww iii of financial markets now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new d day meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side long but dont think that they care about you as a person coming with the atomic bombs one risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands as you like to call them may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack rendering all this useless hold if you can this is a game of patience soon the direction will change fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner or be bankrupt later cant say much but few funds already gave their ceos and managers some quite fat bonuses why this is the last song last dance they are looting the ship before it sinks you have no reason to believe in me im a random guy on the internet but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks if you put all of this together you will see that the silence of operations see the fucking low volume means the silence before the storm wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves if you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior read this if you dont understand it read again this explains why you dont sell and you need to stick together

974,56,2021-03-09 04:39:42,another wsb changed my life story a year ago tonight my best friend was murdered shit sucked still does fucked up my whole life the day of the funeral i lost my job to covid luckily i work at a good restaurant and they brought me back i honestly kinda wish they hadnt as its been so stressful dealing with all the new rules and keeping people safe basically everything that could go wrong has gone wrong this year you know the story you probably lived it this year but all of that changed in november when i saw the short squeeze post it wasnt immediate but suddenly i had something to think about other than how awful life has been i bought and sold and bought and sold and managed to lose like $60 on 40 shares over a few months and was done with gme then my belief was reaffirmed when it started climbing again and i bought back in best decision of my life i finally had a reason to wake up again first it was just because it was a lifetime chance to make some cash but it quickly grew into something indescribable everyone was talking about it at work at the store my brother literally everyone was talking about it but they didnt get you all did we all knew what was coming we watched the storm building and raised our sails trusting that if enough fucking retards did it too the wind would be manageable and we could sail to valhalla leaving the dock wall street aflame i guess it comes full circle again today the squeeze popped off again on a day that couldve left me crippled but its pulled my out i know that its all coincidence but damn if it doesnt feel good you all have changed my life and made me believe in something again i know this is way too long for you smooth brains but thank you for being so damn stupid that this worked
46,9,2021-03-11 16:13:19,can us apes put dfv on the gme board of directors the concept is pretty much all in the subject line innit i will wager that if one were to add up all the gme shares belonging to all us wsb apes and adjunct apes uncles babysitters grandmas wives boyfriends that we actually collectively own a rather large chunk of gme so why not we demand our scion our prophet our dear leader and messiah udeepfuckingvalue sit on the board of directors to represent us and our interests it makes so much intuitive sense to me im smoothbrained as fuck but im sure there are many of you autists out there who would know how to make this happen so how do we make this happen dfv put us on the moon the least we can do is put him on the board assuming that is that he would deign to the issue at hand is also that ryan cohen et al could probably use more allies on the board vs the old guard who are by all accounts useless wastes of space who were running the company into the ground and what are diamondhanded retards if not in actuality just simply good ol fashioned longterm investors i mean i came to wsb looking to gamble and inadvertently became a fucking investor so i guess now why not lets make our retard voices heard in this frikkin company we now own

111,15,2021-03-11 09:23:19,they shook the gme tree today boys i must begin this post by letting you know nothing in this post is financial advice i have only been trading securities for less than one week to say i am a novice trader is an understatement one month ago when news of the gamestop rebellion spread to youtube as well as the lying media i learned about this united group of pubic masterminds that were bringing the crooked hedge funds down to their knees i watched every bought and sold corporate media establishment like the wall street journal the washington post bloomberg abc nbc and every other fake news corporate media media outlet out there demonize the people of reddit they are trying to bring identity politics the very same tool that used to break up occupy wall street the corporate shills said you were right wing extremists and multiple other crazy character assassination allegations lie after lie the world watched as all of these bought and sold fake news outlets tried to steer people away from the truth of what these hedgefunds have been doing to manipulate stocks through their media apparatus driving price down to where the average investor sells low and loses everything and they make billions warren buffett and some of these other rich wall street tycoons have bought out most of our newspapers and real journalist publications back in the 70s and 80s they have been using them to manipulate the market for years i immediately joined to rwallstreetbets and to say it was nothing like i expected would be an understatement like a scene from the movie planet of the apes i saw nothing but and the every single one of these apes were surely headed to the moon in one or another after watching robin hood merrill lynch and other platforms changed the rules to try and screw the average day trader i knew i wanted to get involved i opened up a weeble account and purchased one share of gme at $14200 it wasnt much but its all i can afford on a single income and trying to support a family i didnt really know if yall were really headed to the moon but i knew that if yall got there i wanted to be a part of it my brain is not as smooth as most of yours but we are never going to get to the moon if we dont have to hold onto the it looks like a coordinated attack today from some of the short sellers of gme and some of you dumb didnt have let go you let them knock some of you stupid apes off the but most of you beautiful held on i dont have as much skin in the game as most of yall but im with you lets take this mother fucker straight to the moon i dont have enough karma to respond to this post and hopefully the moderators do not delete it but to close i stand with all of you beautiful that held on to gme today there is still millions and millions in volume we are going to the moon
422,63,2021-03-11 09:18:49,collecting gme articles that were published before the 40 intraday drop disclaimer i am not arguing about the drop i am arguing about the fact that news sources published articles about it before it actually happened i suggest collecting all articles that were published before the drop including timestamps source and author name most importantly if you have archived the article web page with the original publication date please share it thats the strongest prove we have since websites like marketwatch have already changed their publication times edit suggestion from a wrinklybrained gme holder edit 2 did someone break google something is up with google it says a bunch of result are older than they are look at apes scarikg the shit out of headgies gme reddit in this search the post is an hour old but google says 15 hours marketwatch published at 1155am 5 minutes before the drop screenshot 1 2 link to the article with a new publication date authors wallace witkowski and jeremy c owens
150,44,2021-03-10 21:42:04,gme march 10th tech analysis entrypoint edit called it hope everyone managed to get in for other people looking to get into gme today i would recommend the following dip for entry not writing actual numbers to throw off botscrawlers also interesting tidbit todays high is the second last resistance to the ath once we break through the last one were retesting the ath for sure also ive never ever seen the sell button greyed out ever for anything before good luck
413,92,2021-03-10 19:12:58,psa set yourself a target price to stop buying gme yes really serious post i love this stock i wish id bought more before and as the price rises im torn about how much more to yolo and something occurs to me no one knows how this is going to play out we know the price must rise but no one knows how much by no one knows when no one knows for how long no one knows how much ammo the hfs have or what the hidden rules are no one knows the shape of the journey ahead heres one thing we do know they will cheat they will use every trick in the book then they will invent new ones we can laugh as they dig a deeper pit with shorts and buy more dips but even a smoothbrained crayoneating yadda yadda something something retard should expect they they still have new tricks that we havent seen yet i sense a trap the market mechanisms are on our side for once if we buy what we can afford to lose and hold hold hold either we will win or the entire market system still disintegrate i like those odds but this strategy depends on the hold hold hold part fellow apes if you cant afford to hold what you buy dont buy more if you remortgage your house yolo the college fund and get leverage up to the tits there is a chance that the hfs will find a way to artificially and presumably illegally crash the price and through whatever arcane black magic find a way to keep it low as your mortgage payments keep coming in stay liquid apes make sure you can pay the bills spend whatever you can afford to lose on gme but figure out how much that is and for the sake of discipline set yourself a target price to stop buying at maybe stop buying at $1k or $2k or $10k or whatever figure out your own number in advance and stick to it gambling is an addiction and even if you win addiction can shatter families if you buy at $5k and the hfs manage to drag the price down to 100 for six months youre going to have to look at your wife and her boyfriend through the kitchen window every morning knowing that the price will spike again but still having to sleep on the lawn do not put yourself in a position where youre under pressure to sell set a target to stop buying get as much as you can before that point im too dumb to know how to make the rocket emojis but pretend theyre all here
122,137,2021-03-10 10:54:33,im about to make the biggest brain play  ok retards so i was one of the apes who bought gme during the first squeeze and instead of holding or selling at the top i sold and lost my life changing gains by selling at the absolute bottom of almost $40 so naturally this didnt bode well with me but i have a really really good idea so i have decided here and now that i will take out the biggest juiciest fattest loan and im gonna yolo all of it on gme now i know what youre thinking im completely retarded and youre right i definitely have a few extra chromosomes than the majority of you apes but this plan is foolproof i have no debt i have good credit and i simply dont give a fuck because this literally cant go tits up ill either retire early or retire early if u catch my drift so its a win win either way ill update you guys as soon as i can find the meatiest loan to yolo into gme and ill see you guys in my million dollar mansion and tesla in a few weeks also if gme breaks 700 ill go into gamestop and buy every ps5 in stock and give away every single one of them tldr yolo money i dont own to become a multi millionaire edit someone thought i was gonna off myself lmao dont worry im only gonna retire early when i make my millions thanks edit 2 you guys dont understand how much faith i have in gme and all the apes here itll go to 1000 and ill retire ez
348,80,2021-03-10 10:26:25,psa remember to not use robinhood hello fellow ape ive been seeing a bunch of dd saying that the launchpad is prepped for gme and rocket is tminus 16 days to uranus just reminding you that robinhood will limit buying more gme just like they did last time remember to use a broker with a larger balance sheet just like fellow monke mark cuban said schwab fidelity etrade etc remember rocket launches are always bumpy at first only diamond hands will let you hold on
59,88,2021-03-10 10:22:33,the part i dont fully understand what happens after the rocket launches to the moon serious question the basic setup is clear buy gme hold gme at some point over the next couple of weeks or more or less the big squeeze might happen as all the short positions cant dodge anymore and also apparently the rest of the market will be crashing at the same time so lets say it all goes down as hypothesized all those specific conditions engage and the rocket does indeed blastoff moonward then what i guess as the price gets higher and higher more people will begin to be unable to resist the tendies and sell causing the stock which we like to inevitably plunge back down is that correct hold until your nerve breaks diamond hands turn to powder and then unload or wait for word that plotkin has jumped off a building somewhere whats the cueor is it diamond hands into infinity sorry i know this is likely an incredibly dumb question but im retarded
292,36,2021-03-10 09:46:00,meta everyone should be aware of users editing comments as a form vote manipulation there was a highly upvoted comment in the gme daily thread today that was editing to completely change the position of the comment here are the screenshots showing the comment before and after the edit does this violate any specific reddit rules regarding the upvotedownvotes system does this warrant a ban from this subreddit is there a way comments could be locked for editing after reaching certain upvotedownvote thresholds if the spirit of the voting system is to reflect the actual views of the userbase this seems like something that should not be allowed to happen
240,108,2021-03-10 08:53:25,the best case scenario and why it should actually happen  well i guess its about that time again i realized i havent posted any flowery psychology bullshit in over 24 hours and my fingies are starting to itch so im back once more with what i believe to be the most likely scenario that will play out here and once again the key metric that will guide us through this process is that of pain minimization you may have read a recent post about whats called a keynesian beauty contest in which participants are rewarded for selecting what they believe would be the most popular choice overall rather than their own personal preference but i believe this fails to capture the whole picture because it doesnt consider the penalty for being the most harmful only the reward for being the most accommodating what we need to consider are both sides of this coin from the perspective of all players involved how can both sides of this trade the market the regulators the government and the unwitting public all benefit or at the very least not be hurt too badly by the eventual outcome when the dust settles i took the wrong approach last time i tried to dig into this and tried to list every possible scenario this time ill give a rundown of what i believe to be the single least damaging and by extension most beneficial scenario retail investors okay guys youll have to bear with me here because i know a lot of you dont want to hear this but most of this post will be sunshine and rainbows so allow me to temper expectations just a bit i think retail holds i think they will be allowed to exit at or around the peak somewhere within 8085 if theyre paying attention and that should be somewhere upwards of 500kshare but by the same token maybe it shouldnt be i cannot predict the effect that the price spiking to something absurd like a million per share would have that said i am quite certain that 100kshare would have a negligible effect and is a good place to establish a floor with which to work off of how long you hold past that will be up to you and your risk tolerance but i do think you should be careful 500k is not a meme based on the dd nowhere close actually but keep in mind that there are other players involved long institutions whales this one is fairly simple there are a few ways these guys could play this but with the exception of individual whales who are completely unpredictable but always greedy these bigger players will want to maximize profits for their investors while simultaneously bolstering their own image and garnering retail support if acting in a vacuum they would hold until whatever they calculate the ceiling to be then be the first ones out the door but this scenario is as unique psychologically as it is economically the global retail market is watching them closely at the moment they are being praised for their responsible actions and holding with us while pissant hedge funds are taking all the heat but those little hedges have caused a disproportionate amount of uncertainty compared to the assets they control retail is looking for any reason to maintain any faith in our market and if a behemoth like blackrock were to end a rightful squeeze and leave millions of bagholders out to dry they would only deepen the hatred retail has for the market even though that action would be entirely legal as another popular thread from yesterday pointed out you will indeed be able to sell on the way down as will they the smartest play here is to establish a price target for themselves that would maximize profit while also allowing the market to survive largely unscathed then slowly unwind their positions allowing attentive retail to close their positions at attractive price points theyd have helped facilitate the squeeze kept their sterling reputations and even bolstered them lined their clients pockets and millions of new grateful tendieholders would be flocking to them begging to pay them management fees this would crush the small corrupt hedges whom they assuredly hate restore faith in the market consolidate market share please their clients earn them new ones and grow their recurring revenue streams tremendously government theyre either shills or fucking morons but even then the course of action here should be obvious all eyes are on them plenty of regs that make them look tough on wall st but really fuck retail can come later but right now the whole world is watching as much as melvin or citadel might pay you you reaaaally dont want to piss off blackrock or vanguard and as much as you dgaf about your constituents you probably dont want to piss them off either if you can help it plus if you just let this happen you actually look like youre a friend of the little guy instead of just paying lip service to it and you get to collect a tidy 37 tax to do what you will with hell you can even use it to bail out the dtcc if you actually believe they need it the alternative well thats up in the air you could try to step in who knows if the market would ever recover who knows if youve got any shot at reelection you did just fuck your base in realtime after all maybe a few million bucks from the hedge funds would sway you into action just gotta hope theres still an america let alone a market for you to spend it in secfinra i get it they want jobs at the hedge funds cant argue with that just one problem the ones still left wont have a lot to manage if all faith in the market disappears maybe you talk to blackrock and the other big longs maybe you let them know you can only manage up to a few hundred gs a share before you have to shut it down they can exit slowly at that price point and most people end up happy dtcc will get bailed out if they really need it you can even say you were instrumental in obtaining this bailout for them yeah you gotta get tough on a few nobody hedge funds but now youve got a seat at the table with clients at the bank level im sure you could make do with a cushy ibanking gig the alternative again who fucking knows the world already hates you despises you to a degree rarely seen maybe you should be on the right side of this one for once and again a job in finance isnt all that great if faith in our markets ceases to exist dtcc this seems to be the one people are most concerned about id argue the sec is a bigger threat given how patently incompetent they are especially with the new proposed rules the dtcc can basically play this however theyd like look at the players involved you probably recognize more than a few names the amount of capital they have at their disposal is staggering and there are any number of things they could do that we cant even fathom until they happen but i posit that at this point allowing this to squeeze to a reasonable level is by far the most prudent option whether they want to try to keep it around 100k or let it go further intentionally and angle for a bailout isnt particularly important the only thing that would be truly unconscionable would be to make the secgov step in to break one of the cardinal rules all shorts must cover people will fight me on this but 2008 is fresh and january even fresher this would be a colossal third strike and the implications are unimaginable general public the one no ones talking about and the one that inevitably gets fucked the worst in most scenarios you might think that a deep correction or minicrash would be terrible for them it certainly wouldnt feel great but with retail reinvesting a large percentage of profits their portfolios will recover and the tale of gme will stimulate investment they wouldnt wanna miss out on the next one thats never coming but if the government or sec steps in and the fallout is as bad as i predict it would be those portfolios may never recover and theyll see firsthand that normal people simply are not allowed to succeed in this country tldr sorry for the longwinded thread yall this is my opinion on how this should play out and how it would cause minimum pain and maximum gain to the most amount of players involved the only real loser is the shorts and not even their own colleagues like them governmentsec intervention could very well be a death sentence for our market while allowing the squeeze would result in rapid recovery and profound social good tldrottldr live freetarded or die 
76,32,2021-03-10 08:33:54,heres some more reason to stick it to citadel and ken griffin in case you needed any in this article it is described how ken griffin bought a $238 million penthouse in nyc along with other homes in london and chicago the article further talks about how citadel profited from taxpayer bailouts cashing in at least $200 million plus no other exact figures stated in 2009 one year after the 2008 crisis griffin had the audacity to pay himself the lumpy sum of $900 million salary after citadel being on the verge of bankruptcy just one fking year ago citadel declined these figures according to the article linked above they were published by the new york times at the time on top of that he raised his pay up to 17 billion $ in 2015 read the article for yourself and do your own dd and look up other sources but for me this is enough reason to hodl my lumpy single digit number of gme shares forever in case the discussion flair is the wrong choice please let me know and i will change it accordingly just figured that the news flair would not quite fit either as the article was published over a year ago

36,49,2021-03-11 06:12:54,gme $350 questiontheory why its crashing when it hits that mark so i have a theory when gme hits 350 it appears to me that something weird happens like robin hood cancels or there is this flash crash today my theory on this is there is an algorithmic thing going on with clearing and retail purchases as we know it can take up to two days for trades to fully execute during which time the broker and clearing house are on the hook if there is a mismatchbad match or other cock up this risk is massive if there is large amounts of volume in one direction as the clearing house or broker could be the bag holder and then the share price drops as such brokers and clearing houses probably have limits on their exposure to such issues my theory is volitity and rusks hits a predetermined levels in the computer and then the clearing house stops accepting orders from brokers they probably have bench mark for what they determine is the floor of the share value and a probability that of it dropinh while executing in the next 2 days so when the over valued order hits a difference of x eg 350 and say the bench mark 40 and the historic volatility hits y change per day say 40 swing the computer stops accepting thinking there is an error which causes robin hood to put up more capital thus they respond with the buy order ban or the clearing house goes no causing the flash crash as it effectively does the same thing

32,12,2021-03-11 03:00:25,gme going from around 480 on jan25 down to 40 couple weeks ago mean investors at the top lost over 95 if it were to run up over 480 in the next few days or hours no billions in cash can stop it like before since almost every mf that bought it will hold to show off their diamond haired balls and flash a few lambos on the way my analysis is that gme has to go up over 480 because 1 it came down 95 2 the only way to moon is over 480 3 every day close price is higher than the previous 4 maybe every one is tricking the suspend switch this time at saving elite crowd by going it slow as an airplane rather than as a rocket comfy rides are a plus 5 the business goals and the team looks amazing and might have impactful earnings due to the release of ps5 and xbox in q4 and now the actual digital transformation news apes diamond hands adamantium balls retail retards ysk with a very slight unnecessary and useless hedgiecaused pullback it can go to mars well ahead of tesla i made some on gme and lost it all on other shit now going to get back in wish me yolo luck edit i like the stock

62,36,2021-03-11 00:59:19,aso early bird special academy sports is a sports and out door chain that saw 139 earnings surprise last earnings announcement and is currently the third most shorted stock at almost 40 if you think there was institutional influence holding down gme you havent seen anything yet aso has a much smaller float 32 million compared to gmes 50m skts 90m and rkts 106m it also has a much smaller average daily volume compared to the other most shorted stocks at 15 million although $40 options just opened up previously the only otm options were $25 $30 and $35 if you look at the last few weeks price at expiry you will see for instance last week that at expiry the price was just below $25 and immediately went up past $25 after the options expired worthless this is a company that had a breakout earnings beating both earnings and revenue and has another earnings announcement coming this month last earnings was so great because of the increased sales of guns ammo and out doors equipment from the quarter ending october 1 the last quarter of 2020 saw an increase in the sales of guns and ammo across the board it also saw more school sports increase as states start to reopen so far this quarter which will not be in the earnings report we saw the third highest increase in gun sales we also see texas and other states that are big aso earners completely reopen getting back to institutional shenanigans not only do you see the price fall below the $25 call weekly on low volume trades despite running up the day or week before but you can also see price suppression daily look at the average volume of mondays 13 run up and then look at the volume it took to drive it back down to $25 on tuesday if you look at the daily chart for the past month you will see a roller coaster ride of 13 ups and downs hourly each time ive seen something like this it was either institutions shaking out weak hands or gmes first pop i understand that most are diamond handing gme and it may have room to run but i believe that not only is aso overshorted and will have another stellar earnings driving the price higher causing a squeeze but that it is a fundamentally undervalued company i currently hold 20 april 16 $25c and 5 april 16 $35

5,3,2021-03-11 00:45:37,datto msp earnings report take a minute away from $rblx and gme today to check out this play a month ago i posted about datto $msp a backupdisaster recovery service network equipment manufacturer for it consultantsmanaged service providers and how there was a solid options play around their earnings report on 311 a month later and that play still exists the $20 call options for 319 ask is currently $590 and the stock is at $2530 this means the stock only has to go up $060 during their earnings report release tomorrow for this to be a winner seems like a really low iv and a solid play the $25 call option has a really low bar to make money on it too not financial advise i just like the company and the stock and options gambles edit $25 call option jumped in price but the $20 call is still good looking$2570 threshold for profit and stock at $2538
168,113,2021-03-11 13:49:58,why the price of gme shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k while reading through comments on wsb this week ive seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for gme this post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets consider the fact that even if gamestops market capitalization briefly reaches $2t it still will not be the most valuable company in the world that title will remain with apple at a market cap of $2t shares of gme will be worth $28680 at a share price of $10k gamestops market capitalization will be $700b less than those of companies such as alibaba tencent facebook alphabet amazon microsoft and apple now from the perspective of fundamentals it doesnt make sense to compare gamestops market cap to those of the companies just mentioned however in the context of a short squeeze it seems like a reasonable comparison especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that gamestop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world and that possibility is quite plausible remember that volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008 you might say well maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008 so the bar for vw was lower ok fair point but at the peak of the vw short squeeze vw attained a market cap of $420b according to the world bank see the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $3227t in 2008 and $6865t in 2018 so at the peak of the vw short squeeze vw accounted for roughly 0423227 13 of total market cap in 2018 13 of total market cap was $00136865t $893b at a market cap of $893b gme shares will be worth $12806 and this is a conservative estimate since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018 tldr the price of gme shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k obligatory

16,22,2021-03-11 12:49:04,in need of confirmation of these damn shorts alright i just need some clarification for this ape because logically short selling makes no sense what so ever in todays society besides for the hedge funds correct me if im wrong x200b so simply theres a lender out there that feels like lending a stock random example that is currently at $10 a short seller thinks that stock is gonna do horribly and is probably actually worth $250 so the short seller borrows that stock and sells it to joe down the road for market price of $10 we wait and see that the seller was right the stock is now worth $250 and is able to buy the stock at that price returning it to the lender at $250 and pocketing the other $750 now what i dont get is why the lender or the buyer would want to take part in this deal x200b for the lender unless its a stock that theyre probably never going to sell it could dip to 1 cent but they plan to hold on to it so why not lend it for a bit of time they lend a stock thats worth $10 and get the same stock returned but now worth $250 why do that when the lender could just sell it themselves for $10 is it truly just people who never plan on selling that lend and joe who buys the stock from the short seller loses $750 value on that stock they just purchased from that seller the seller obviously doesnt tell joe that they think the stock is shit so joe buys it and it just comes down to the seller being a shitty person trying to make some easy gain x200b am i missing something in the day of the dinosaurs sure the internet wasnt a thing so it was harder to be on the up and up with stocks but technology is all around now please explain to this smooth brain x200b also was an exhilarating ride on the gme rollercoaster today cant wait for tomorrow

191,47,2021-03-11 09:45:07,learn from my mistake take off your stop losses volatile stocks are stocks you do not want to have stop losses on i had an average of 207 of 13 shares on gme every time i leave my house i put a stop loss at my average but you wont regain where you had your stop loss because of the volatility the set loss was at 175 a total loss of 400 why did i have a stop loss in the first place so i can sell my shares and buy the dip for more of a profit and more shares edit actually i lost more than 400 i lost the potential gains from my average being at 207 learn from my mistake side note i still have my rh account with a lower average that didnt trigger a stop loss so im still in the game tomorrow i will seek my revenge and buy more shares hopefully my 13 again fun fact i just learned hf know where you set your stop loss so they can trigger it and you lose your shares
309,56,2021-03-11 09:20:55,the 2nd squeeze will be big gme ta x200b aight you retards this some serious shit we gonna go through strap in because the so called 2nd squeeze will be big even though it isnt the squeeze we all know will eventually happen that will fk over hfs and allow us to finally land on mars with elons rocket ship alright so looking at the chart for gme over the last 3 months we can see there is a large spike after the initial run up highlighted by the small white box before the large blue box from corner to corner closing prices for those days is what i believe is the run up before the squeeze just a metaphor this area goes from $1995 to $4303 or an increase of about 216 x216 now when looking at the blue box that follows we can see that from corner to corner we have a price range of $4303 to $34751 or an increase of 808 x808 now when comparing the increases on both days we can see that the 216 run up over a period of 7 trading days led an 808 gain or a x374 increase this means that for each day that passes within the run up is an increase in the multiplying factor by 0534 resulting in our 808 increase for the apparent squeeze just to double check with that x216 increase of the run up we can apply this and multiply by 374 0534 7 days this leads to the 808 increase that we calculated above so assuming that this x0534 factor stays true lets apply this to the recent run up we had starting 13 trading days ago over this period of 13 trading days for the current run up we have a range of $4497 to $26299 or a 585 increase x585 applying the run up factor of 0534 13 trading days 0534 6942 6942 585 4061 4061 the closing price of today $26299 a closing price of the height of the 2nd squeeze of $1068002 or an increase of 4061 tldr we will have an increase of about 4000 during the apparent 2nd squeeze to have a share price of $1068002 hold the fking line edit yes i have no fking idea what im doing
1822,214,2021-03-11 08:45:10,gme technical analysis from a retard part 3 why i think the short squeeze is nearly here last week i drew out a chart looking like this lets see the results the chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area the only difference is the chart has a retarded doji instead of a normal candlestick this retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher close to happening let me break it down the gme rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode we have just completed a cup handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze this is due to iv implied volatility for instance lets say gme increased from $260 to $269 that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 34 increase now lets say gme was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29 it would be the same dollar difference but with a 45 increase in share price this time this is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in january was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low iv it went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldnt handle now that gme has had a steady increase to $260 per share it has a much higher iv will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73 increase its crucial that gme sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase its iv and have the ability to go to $69420 per share from a technical point of view why the stock was heavily attacked today what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it will we established that gme had enough iv to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time thats a 3000 increase that means that if gme can slowly get to $2314 per share this will be the launch pad for gme to increase by 3000 to go to $69420 per share to go to $2314 from where its at now at $265 thats only an 873 increase which is much less than the 3000 increase in january a crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120 this is crucial as the fact the stock didnt crash back down means that the 300 increase is sustainable for the iv using this calculation i can concur that in order for gme to get to $2314 per share stay there it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300 to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420 this is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless if a low iv causes a major move to the upside to crash back down that means that a major move to the downside will cause the stock to go up this is why hedge funds are truly fucked because this was their only opportunity to try trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180 they still havent covered yet what they have done now is actually increase the iv of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be even easier to get to $69420 if you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear i am only talking about how gme needs a steady uprise it doesnt matter if it has sharp dips they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker i have to say its very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today make the stock tank 40 then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling that is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and its shareholders who just like the stock werent ready for a 40 loss on their investment its not the shareholders fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100 thats a conscious decision they made themselves to do turned out to be a bad one it shouldnt be the reason why honest shareholders saw an unprecedented 40 loss on their investment today tldr i like the stock its fundamentals i think its a great company they generated over 6b revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into ecommerce i believe they will become one of the worlds leading gaming companies i am very bullish on gme i like the stock it seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock the company i believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold the short squeeze is just another attraction interesting to see analyse this is not financial advice i am just a retard who did some math and came up with random numbers
19,15,2021-03-11 08:41:48,so my monkey brain tried some visual analysis aka crayon art in order to predict the future other apes plss help  after todays madness i really needed to figure out what could happen next my small retard brain couldnt stand the looses while holding i took major brain dmg while watching the stonk drop like a rock totally legit so please excuse my crayon drawings on that this is what i found this was january 28th when this rocket was about to lift off not red crayon circles x200b picture from first peak drop on 0128 the squeeze was not squozen then as you can see gme reached a price of around 419$ per share rocket emoji this is a picture of todays lift off once again red crayon pls picture from second peak drop today still not squozzon as you can see gme reached a price of around 340$ per share today and it was just starting the lift off the super smart monkeyfellas maybe already noticed so probably nobody cause nobody is reading this anymore in january it took them about 80 minutes to dumb the price to 152$ i am just rounding here cause you get the idea even without the exact numbers totally legit free market chart 1 this is how it looked today it took them only 30 minutes to dumb the price back to 219$ per share i guess it even dipped to 170$ right totally legit free market chart 2 so that is already pretty sus but not yet finished lemme get a new banana for the next part after this huge dip the price stabilized on both scenarios on the first peak in january it looked like that moving back up ending at 224$ per share today it looked like that moving back up ending at 265$ per share so it seems like this total madness already happened to us on january 28th somehow i totally deleted this painful experience from my brain probably some retarded diamond hands copeing mechanism they did it once and we returned back sadly this story doesnt end well as many of you apes might know the stock kept diving into the ground probably there were other circumstances with vlad scking the hedgies dcks and stuff but as a retarded ape who has 35 shares 118 proof i am kinda pissed i really hope that this time the whole thing will turn around and dont get dumbed like last time cause if this isnt market manipulation at its best then i dont know tldr stand together as apes dont read when youre looking for bias this is definitely no financial advice i dont even listen to myself so i definetly wouldnt listen to me when i were you just some crayon dd on my beloved gme stocks happy to hear your thoughts on this

82,27,2021-03-11 08:23:00,my $600000 yolo on 312 gme 500 calls at least i made a profit so on monday i threw over $6k into gme 500 calls expiring 312 x200b on tuesday i was up to $11k in the first hour of market open but that dwindled away fast as the sideways movement yesterday killed the premium on the options i was glued to my screen and watched as each minute my balance fell more and more x200b then today i was initially down in the morning just for a minute but suddenly things picked up big time at 1100am i was up $3200000 i currently owe about twice that in student loans and i told myself i wouldnt sell until the options were worth what i owed in student loans i refinanced my loans so they are now privately held and thus i have no hope for forgiveness then the gme drop and halts happened my $3200000 dropped to next to nothing in minutes while a strike price of 500 for friday is doable its pretty fucking risky at this point and with each passing day the option premium drops significantly theta at one point was like 42 so i waited a tiny bit after the batch of halts i was basically gambling yet again and the options were finally about double the price i originally paid i didnt want to be a slaughtered pig and rather than focus on the $3200000 i missed out on i realized i should be fucking happy i was able to get out with over $500000 in profit i had bought the contracts at an average of $48 and sold at $705 x200b my closing trade x200b final balance tldr i dont have diamond hands but im not ashamed i also am proud that my trade didnt have an impact on the hard work all you apes are doing in holding shares since they are options contracts of course it wouldve been great if i held and then they become itm on friday but ill take a $5k win over a $6k loss anyday

0,106,2021-03-12 00:54:34,what the gme gamma squeeze needs to keep going and why it will probably run out of fuel these are my thoughts on a very solid article on the gme gamma squeeze which fits the available data well and shows a reasonable case for both correlation and causation between otm call option buying and the stock price movements it can be found here and has been doing the rounds on wsb to be fair only apes bagholders or the very inexperienced actually believed the reason was a short squeeze you cant tell them that though no matter what evidence is given to the contrary the gamma squeeze theory seems a very credible explanation for the volatility here are a couple of other thoughts i had while reading the article that support a very bearish case x200b 1 a gamma squeeze needs at least two criteria for the the stock to keep rising a people buying otm calls in very large volumes b the stock rises to a unexpectedly rapidly to a point where those calls sold by market makers are in the money and they need to buy stock or calls themselves of different deltas and expirys to rehedge there are at serious problems for the bulls if these conditions dont occur and we may well see a share price implosion as the gamma squeeze ends remember this is the only thing keeping up the price at this moment as its clearly not fundamentals its a 1525$ stock or a short squeeze here the issues with condition a looking at the atm weekly call 250$ expiring march 19 we see from yesterdays price that it is $7500 75$ giving a breakeven price at expiry not paying any attention to the other greeks which given the theta decay and possible iv movements will hurt the buyer of $325 the 350$ strike with the same expiry trades at around 47$ 4700$giving a break even price of 397$ now the problem with this is simple these very risky call options are simply far to pricey for the average ape to afford even those well otm usually the retards might be able to afford a short term weekly otm lottery ticket type option that you see yoloed here on wsb all the time but in this case due to the rise in share price and insanely high premium implied volatility the vast majority of apes are well priced out a $7500 or even riskier $4700 option that expires in a week is way beyond the budget of these guys in addition iv has been rising on the increased volatility the last couple of days and earnings is just two weeks away iv typically rises strongly on options coming into earnings so these calls will become even more expensive even if no share price drop occurs ironically the gamma spike will become a victim of its own success here are the issues with condition b of course the share price is pretty volatile day to day so im not going to try to predict it but i would note a couple of important points the share price has risen due to the gamma squeeze see article and once people realize this many who dont understand it or thought the reason was due to a short squeeze may become very fearful as a gamma squeeze is a very short term phenomenon the holders will see the share price as completely outside their control and holding or buying the dip retailers volume is estimated to be around 110th of institutionsmmsquant funds hedgies most days at least makes no difference this isnt a short squeeze after all additionally they will see that as the share price is totally dependent on what the hedge funds want to do with it and can be manipulated at will see yesterdays 40 drop in 20 minutes to suit their needs and we dont know what hedge funds are long put options or long the stock short term algos and so on maybe they want it up temporarily if they are running momentum based algos or calls but if they hold puts they will want it down we simply dont know for sure other than to note the current open interest putcall ratio is around 31 or the market has about 3x as many open puts as it does calls more importantly for the share price to gamma squeeze you need condition a to be fulfilled it is the engine of the rocket and for fuel needs retards to buy otm calls on mass this is not happening anymore secondly the gamma squeeze is caused by market makers who essentially want to be approximately delta neutral rehedging their position again this poses massive risks for bulls as you need to consider what will happen if the share price begins to drop as the price drops those otm and atm calls they sold to autists and the general trader will begin to decline in value now if the price drops enough as an example if you bought just before the halt that atm weekly 250 strike call was worth around 141$ and it dropped to 73$ a massive loss the market makers will begin to rehedge their risk in any of these ways buy the call back for a significant discount or leave it for a few days to get it even cheaper due to theta decay this means they can sell all 100 shares they may of been holding before as a hedge to price rises buy the now other now much cheaper calls to hedge their original sold call and sell some of the shares used to hedge now ive kind of skipped over the details here but this is the essence of what shouldcould happen now of course those calls themselves that are used to rehedge will also have to be rehedged by other market makers but usually its much cheaper to rehedge a suddenly otm call that you sold for maybe 50 delta that has dropped to 20 delta it requires less purchase of the underlying so basically the net effect of a price drop will cause kind of a chain reaction as the price drops the market makers rehedge their sold calls and sell shares and this in turn drops the price and the pattern continues it has similarities but is not the same im not saying that at all to a gamma squeeze except now its reversed and the price drops caused by such a chain reaction probably wouldnt be as violent this is because the potential upside on calls is unlimited stock price can moon indefinitely in theory and thus are riskier for market makers but if they sell a put the most they can lose is capped when the stock hits 0 tldr bulls are likely fuk if the gamma squeeze cant be sustained this is due to market makers rehedging atmotm sold calls and no longer needing to hold underlying shares as a hedge in the same quantities thus selling the shares and further driving down the price whatever happens bulls are fuk as this was a gamma squeeze from 40ish$ up to crazy numbers and gamma squeezes correct very quickly hoursdays especially once people realize what is going on positions tons of different puts spreads at different strikes at expirys 2343 days out edit a helpful person mentioned that i should have explicitly stated that you need both extremely bullish itm and otm call option activity to create a gamma squeeze i totally agree and should have mentioned that
104,43,2021-03-11 22:23:38,the delevering of citadel and melvin capital via $expe it has become apparent through recent events that the fate of citadel and melvin capital are inextricably linked one might even say melvin capital is a thinly veiled shell company for citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure in the event of a catastrophic market event gme mother of all short squeezes for example citadel and melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions for melvin capital this would start with expedia their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $15b in current market value x200b interestingly enough expedia is currently trading at alltime historical highs near $170share with a recent nasty pullback in january of this year to $120 range expedia average daily volume is only 35 million and a share float of 113 million this means melvin capitals total expe long position is 10 of the entire expe public share float if melvin capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its expedia holdings the short term price of expe would capitulate downward potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their expe exposure i have nothing against expedia but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional delevering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback
2217,171,2021-03-11 21:52:10,the world of trading is changing because of you apes  alright smooth brains this has been on my mind for a while and i think im finally seeing how this plays out long term so down a shot of hedgie tears and be entertained by my weird thought process for decades the avid retail investor has looked to an authority for trading advice whether it be the news or a financial advisor they took shelter under their dd thinking they knew what they were talking about only to end up in the red or make a 5 gain which they called a win but in recent years as social media rose to be king there has been a shift in who investors have deemed the authority news lost its audience and they started taking sides offering airtime to greedy folk who saw an opportunity to trick investors into thinking they were there for the little guy be careful of rich celebs who take our sides as they could be playing both sides why am i bringing this up well look around here we are on a subreddit reading dd by anonymous investors and taking their word over those we can see on the television what does that tell me the avid retail investor has little to no trust the msm are talking in their best interests theyve taken on their authoritarian position and assumed they were the gods of stocks and could move money better than the hedgies could how wrong they were theyve come to the realisation they are losing and now out to make an example of those pesky retail investors who ignored their calls to sell but instead bought the dip andor held they want them to lose so bad to prove they were just gamblers who are trying to manipulate the market total bullshit we like the stock i wont go into detail here cause weve seen it being plastered all over the subreddits the msm lying so where am i going with this people today are the new model of stock trading the behaviours are not the same as boomers they hold when told to sell by the msm the dd is comprehensive and detailed beyond basic understanding reasons are explained and any stock boomer lingo like shorting buying calls or puts is explained for any simple ape to understand so not only is the average retail investor learning how the market works at a rapid pace but now knows what signs to look for when theyre looking into a stock gme has taught many how to react when the market is rigged the talk of diamond hands has not only been taught but is now in the process of forming how the retail investor behaves in a declining market when the boomers would paper hand and cut their loses were entering a new era where retail investors are far more educated the stock market lingo is broken to simple explanations making it easier for new investors to get up to speed we find humour in an otherwise boring world filled with green red and numbers not only is the retail market growing but itll become the strongest backbone when red comes there wont be big sell orders theyll simply buy the dip and ride it out the money made wont be out of greed its made out of the want for a better more comfortable life the taxes will hopefully go towards improving their society and fuel the economy for decades to come change is coming and its for the good tldr hedgies and the msm are going to lose to a bunch of retail investors called apes who can just about read eat bananas and snort crayons for entertainment and cant find the sell button
42,79,2021-03-11 20:39:14,short interest enough for gme today i noticed an article from yahoo finance stating that short interest has decreased they list s3 partners as a source for this image s3 partners is a fintech company who measure short interest seems all solid until i found the twitter of s3 partners retweeting a tweet that gme is one of the most squeezable stocks at this moment the tweet was posted 21 hours ago so that could still mean it has decreased afterwards i stumbled on the account of ihor dusaniwsky managing director of predictive analytics at s3 partners i cannot confirm at this moment if this is his real twitter account but it seems to be legit 10 hours ago he tweeted $gme is still in a moderate short squeeze as shorts continue to slowly close their positions i still see it as a short sqeeuze candidate now these two things seem to contradict each other or am i reading this wrong did short interest decrease but not enough to not have a short squeeze happen is yahoo finance quoting the wrong numbers since the managing director of s3 tweeted there is still enough interest help me out fam i own 5 shares of gme
120,15,2021-03-11 20:14:44,what is high frequency trading hft and what does it do to stocks explained first of all i have to congratulate to all apes that hold this attractive stock with their diamond hands and shoutout to everyone who even bought the rediculous dip that we all witnessed yesterday 10th so i want to explain what hft is and how the ultra rich use it some of you might be too young to witness and some heard of these mega bubbles like the dotcom bubble 2000 and the real estate bubble 200708 you might have heard about the movies of wall street margin call or boiler room that are based on the events that happened before lets get this straight market manipulation has always been a part of the stockmarket such as insider buying or selling with large ordersfor that you could as a normal trader find still a way to be profitable but with internet and technology that just got better and better over time the softwares with high frequency computer tradingalgorithm have changed this market manipulation that we see today so what is this software such software is capable of doing trades in milliseconds they are used to drive stocks up rediculously high or down it gives the people that are watching this an optical illusion that a stock is being bought with momentum or sold with force so good luck being a technical trader by selling stocks as soon as they buy them the hft is manipulating price differences faster trades more money in hft it doesnt matter how much money is moving in each direction per trade its the amount of trades the program can make in a split second thats important so if you can make like 10000 trades every second and arbitrage 00001 cents per trade thats 1$ every second 60$ every minute and 3600$ every hour and then there is fake news if someone decides to create panic they simply make some news post it ape stuck in bananaprocessing machine production halted and as soon as this is posted the stock of your bananacompany that you have invested in has dropped before you could even react onto it and who loses money the normal investors mostly retailers so if anyone talks that a retailer is able to manipulate a market while these big boys have 7080 power over it thats fake news we can prolly give it momentum but thats all but the real battle is between the bigboys themselves because each one of them has such a machine and it must be better than the other in order to win so what these programs are designed to do apart from making trades in milliseconds they also fake in milliseconds the trade orders are sent to throw a kink into competing programs many trades are just made to flood the market and trick other computersinvestors into thinking that a trend may be occurring in a particular stock when no trend really exists so these programs are made to read feeds and analyze data but they cant varify wether this data is true or not so wether the ape stuck in bananamachine and the production is halted news is true or not the stock will fall because the bot reads it the same way when you play an online game the program cannot see and decide wether you are sabotaging the game or you are just bad af but if you for example write some words especially negative they immediatly strike you with a ban how do we know we are in a bubble when you make cash easy and the bubble grows exponentially higher when these bots are included aswell and why will the stockmarket crash because of easy money so some should consider after this bubble bursts that trading might not be the same again then we talk about a bearish market and as normal trader it is impossible to beat the market if you wanna invest invest in a company that you believe in a longterm growth gme will be one of a kind thing things will change after that

79,22,2021-03-11 15:18:50,discussing about forbes article and possible gamma squeeze retaliation if you havent read that forbes article that came out today you should its really interesting and helped me understand the underlying mechanisms driving this gme growth and why it will continue however it also gave me an idea of what happened today and i want some feedback on the theoretical and thoughts on why they wouldnt just keep doing this the article describes the price rise driven by the need for mm to cover calls if they sell 100k calls on a volatile and rising stock that are very likely going to actually buy those shares so the calls are covered after two weeks of heavy call volume they have maybe 1mil shares purchased at various prices that they will lose money on if the price keeps rising and they print lets say theyre average price is $275 but the average call strike is $250 i dont understand options enough to know if this scenario is reasonable out how much money they would stand to lose so apologies if im drifting off base so if im sitting on a million shares looking down the barrel of massive losses and i know i cant stop the increasing price why not flood the market with those million shares i have so the price plummets and then buy them back at much lower prices to bring my average down and possibly actually make money delivering itm calls it would almost be like buying the shares two weeks before selling the calls charging current rates on shares you bought at a discount so in this scenario they may have dumped shares for an average price of $300 banking that $25 premium but since they need those shares for delivery and arent willing to take the risk that their stunt will keep the price depressed they buy them back at an average of $225 $25 less than the average call strike they net $50 per share without taking the risk of selling uncovered calls if theyre smart they used that additional $50 profit to buy additional shares at the depressed price so they can sell additional covered calls with a lower cost basis so can someone tell me why this wouldnt work or why its probably not what happened because im sitting here after the fact thinking to myself if i was an evil fuck with loads of money to push shit around and i dont want to lose any of it what would i do and this is exactly what i would do and if this is a reasonable hypothesis about what happened whats to stop them from doing it every week i know it doesnt hurt us financially just psychologically if we hold through it but it will eventually scare more and more people away whats the recourse anyone care to weigh in
15543,951,2021-03-11 14:34:40,technical analysis of todays gme movement photosexplanations included after watching todays shenanigans i thought i would breakdown some of todays movements with brief explanations x200b gme steadily has been producing some great gains this week opening monday bright and early at 15489 and finally opening today at 269 looking poised to make our moonshot unfortunately after peaking above 330 after a series of trading halts plummeted down to 198 with restabilization by eod to the unexperienced eye and paper hands this looks like a time to sell however to the experienced trader this is a textbook salmon chart lemme explain it clearly to the retarded paper hands here x200b the graph to a newbie but if you look closely a pattern emerges behold the sockeye salmon chart the sockeye salmon chart movement is a dead giveaway it begins as a massive dip that goes below red to match the color of breeding sockeye then some wacky shit for the ventral fin and we have stabilized at the belly of the fish in the green for approaching the head but what about the natural predator of salmon coming to spawn x200b thats right gay bears are behind this shit bears the natural antithesis of salmon and gay bears the antithesis of the retail traders but how have the gay bears forced the stock to plummet what manipulation did they have this time you may be familiar to ladder attacks but let me introduce you to fish ladder attacks this is a fish ladder for the uninitiated ladders allow fish to get upstream to spawn wealth despite hedge funds preventing direct uninhibited access hedgefunds have stationed gay bears at the ladders to eat the incoming paperhanded salmon which was the primary driver in todays major crash but whats that tube representing retail trading a larger diagram explaining how the parties are interacting thats right its salmon tube time x200b but whos loading the salmon diamond hands ryan cohen and other big players are literally loading willing salmon into the tube to bypass the gaybears and fish ladder attacks to take us straight to valhalla for our tendie spawn prediction graph for the upcoming days x200b come take me to the upstream all you gotta do to hodl disclaimer i am not an investment advisor or wildlife ecologist this is not investment or fishery advice i just like the stock and the sockeye x200b edit holy shit i love yall godspeed to tendieland everyone

3510,374,2021-03-12 02:11:16,explaining it like youre in second grade hello wsb how are things yes yes i know gme looks a little red today butnot financial advice it will maybe likely probably go up who knows not me anyway yesterday someone asked in the megathread to explain exactly how anyone could think a price point of $1000 was possible and to explain it to them like they are in second grade so i did as i did so i thoughtman there are a lot of retards in this subreddit maybe i should post some other aspects of this whole gme thing like they are in second gradewhich may be hard to understand for some of you and thats fine ask your wifes boyfriend for help as needed and spread some of this education around so i present to you gme like youre in second grade rocks stocks it rhymes get it nice and easy to follow 1 how is a price of $1000 even possible imagine your friend has 100 rocks i borrow them and sell them to other people for $5 each i pay your friend $1 a day to borrow these rocks i do this because i think in the future i can buy 100 rocks for $2 each$200 total and thus make a $300 profit so long as it doesnt take me more than 200 days to do this i turn a profit well some retarded apes find out that all the rocks are borrowed so they buy up all the rocks they refuse to sell those rocks for reasonable prices your friend now tells me i need my fucking rocks or my next visit is to your family and i wont be asking nicely what do i do do i let your friend kneecap my wife over some fucking rocks of course not i take the loss and buy the 100 rocks i owe for whatever price they are being sold for one guy sells me 10 rocks for $10 each his friend has 5 rocks and wont sell for less than $15 each the next guy wants $20 for his 2 as there are fewer rocks they sell for more because people know im desperate the last guy says fuck you man i wont sell for less than $69420 i get a text message with a picture of my front door i buy the fucking rock when the time comes the short sellers will have to cover the only thing that could stop that is if gme files for bankruptcy or is unlisted from the nysecorrect me if im wrong here retarded ape too 2 how are the hedge funds able to keep dropping the price of gme so much i thought stocks only went up no worries billy i got you so imagine the same situation above alright when your friend comes knocking on my door for his rocks he finds that i moved and didnt leave a forwarding address while hes busy searching for my wife to break her kneecaps ive grabbed a buddy and hit the rock market i see all these people selling rocks for $250 $275 one guy asking for $69420 like an asshole i buy a couple of rocks at the asking price its a small price to pay overall i then start yelling selling rocks $249 come and get them my friend was closest to me and before all the others can run over he buys them from me for $249 everyone is yelling buy the dip rocks on sale omg rocket diamond rocket and my friend looks at his rocks and is like eh just some rocks fuck it anyone buying at $248 someone runs up who looks nothing like me because he has a hat and large mustache and i 100 definitely do not and immediately buy them all for $248 this is repeated a few times till my friend is buying them from me for $230 each well that guy that was selling for $275 he bought them from some other asshole for $315 he sees how many are selling for so low and now hes worried damn i cant afford tendies if i lose all of my money maybe only a $75 loss is okay so he runs over to the rock market and yells selling for $225 now weve got an issue he scared and so are other people everyone freezes for a moment suddenly worried how much can we lose sell sell sell sell lower and lower as each person in line worries that they are going to lose too much or they want to sell now and buy back in at a lower price suddenly i and my friend are tossing rocks back and forth at $165 each and the literal children around us are crying finally i have them all back in my hands anyone wanna buy for $300 3 the fucks a short squeeze anyway alright so imagine the above ive borrowed a bunch of rocks but the price has gone way above what i thought it would ive run out of excess funds ive run out of time mommy sec is calling me home and i dont wanna be late i need to buy 100 rocks right now so i pull out my thick boy wallet and yell buying rocks whatever price and kids start pouring out of the woodwork as they do they grab fistfuls of cash out of my wallet and drop rocks at my feet bigger and bigger handfuls till one asshole literally punches me in the balls hangs me upside down and shakes me till $100k drops out of my pockets im not gonna say he spit on me as he walked away but he probably did this is a short squeeze im not allowed to play outside anymore and need to get home before mommy spanks me i needed to get my rocks now so paid any price for them mini question but what if you ran out of money before you got all your rocks in a nice world where everything works out big daddy fed comes to the rescue he says sport you shouldnt have wasted billions of dollars on rocks i always knew you were retarded but youre my good little boy so ill help he then prints out billions of big daddy fed dollars to cover the rest of my rock purchases 4 so what actually are the short sellers playing at then so same situation as above while your friend is trying to track me down im pushing the value of rocks down as far as i can im doing this because if i have to buy all 100 rocks at $69420 im going to lose a lot of money but if i can drive the price really far down i can lower how much i can lose overall which is as close to winning as im likely to get in a short squeeze situation my losses could be infinite of course i dont want that the fed doesnt want that so they are giving me as much time as possible because mommy sec loves me and daddy fed doesnt want to pay for my rock shortage they are willing to wait instead of spanking me as they should probably because i caught daddy fed with the neighbor and mommy sec has been taking money from other children but who actually knows anyway thats all ive got for the time being if you have any other questions ask someone else im a retarded ape that cant stop buying the dip so what do i actually know anyway

76,160,2021-03-13 07:33:22,to anyone who invested significant life savings or taking out debt to go all in on gme i went all in on gme last time and held from $40 to $105 this time i bought like 2 shares and rode them from $160 to $326 i wouldnt have really cared had these shares gone to shit despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you a price increase to 800$ is not certain a lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now the volume yesterday and today combined is the same as the total float this is huge the volume on wednesday was 71mil which is bigger than the actual float while i am sure that the short interest right now is still very high because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels im confident that 90 of shares shorted at 4090$ have already been squeezed out causing the massive price increases to $340 the only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200300$ but this would be very hard since the price is already so high not impossible but not certain despite all the hivemind shit you hear on this sub you need to control your risk and if youre betting a large part of your life on this succeeding you should sell gme until movement in the stock doesnt dictate your financial security retailers are not driving the price anyway so dont lose your life savings and go into debt because you saw a apes together strong meme or some dumb shit the most ironic shit is that if you follow wsb advice you can never win because even if a squeeze happens the posts here will tell you that its not the real squeeze hold dont sell so you can never actually profit from it by selling to the shorts that need to cover selling to them is left up to some smart retailers and mainly the institutions that are playing the long game on this dont help them help yourself control your risk have fun but make sure you know that this is dumb as fuck tldr another squeeze might happen but not certain make sure you know that even if you wouldnt get this impression by browsing this sub dont bet your financial security on this edit the retard meme is more than a meme i guess edit2 btw i still own one share for the meme but would be totally fine if it lost 80 of its value

59,32,2021-03-13 07:28:11,why just purchasing $800 calls isnt enough for  ive read a few times now that the gamma squeeze is best squoze by the purchase of calls particularly high multiple calls i even read one apes theory that we should all purhase call options and that all those apes holding 4 shares of gme dont belong on the with us this is based on the assumption that mms who are writingselling these options are always hedging by buying the underlying asset thus creating a huge leverage effect i believe in some instances this may not be the case when you look at the sheer number of $800 calls that were purchased and expiring today it far exceeds other more reasonable call levels say a mm decided the probability of gme hitting $800 today was exceedingly low especially since they understand they could actually drive it there through the gamma effect mentioned previously this mm may decide to just sell all hedging gme shares and sell those options naked this would have netted them profits from a sideways day of trading and expiration of calls not in the money this is why we need to purchase calls at all levels and the underlying asset as well each in the money call option does force mms to hedge and every diamond handed ape out there is driving the price up too even if they only hold 4 sharesone ape weak many apes strong buy all things that go green eat green crayons and to get

367,50,2021-03-12 14:34:14,have i been brainwashed or have i become retarded i was lucky enough to have some cash last year at this time when everything dumped i bought bunches of things at deep discounts and made a decent return on those investments when the gme spike happened in january i of course late to the party bought a little at $290 as the price dropped then a little more at $230 when the price kept dropping a bit more at $190 when the price kept dropping long story short i found myself in about $5k more than i had planned and suddenly the stock was in the $40s for a while an uncomfortably long time really i started to tell myself what a mistake i made i started following the wsb thingy here and reading the dd comments and everything and i really bought into all of this made me feel much more comfortable about risk vs potential reward and the once in a lifetime chance that this really is to stick it to the system bought a bunch more at $46 finding myself at 100 shares at $114 average right before this last liftoff bought 20 more for $185 during yesterdays dip seems im an expert now just like all of you seriously though i have learned tons from this group and so many things i didnt know before about this ridiculously rigged system no interest in selling any of it any more feels weirdly comfortable i always was a paste guy but now i like crayons too
248,67,2021-03-12 12:04:42,future sole owner of gamestop here with a breakdown of whats to come how do you do fellow investors obligatory i eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here expect to lose money you have been warned looking at the recent market shenanigans the price action you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this exblockbusteresque company that i intend to own aaand the way short sellers big fish hedgies are using gme to engage in their pissing contests ive finally figured out how this shits gonna go and you better believe im poising myself to acquire this company in the process heres how this is about to shake out with gamestop in the coming weeksmonths the stock aint going smoothly over $350 when and if it does get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis $350 is apparently a magic number melvin and the shorters are terrified of not sure why but each time we get too close their strategies go from what can only be described as absolute unfair horseshit to fuck it burn everything to the ground in a split second they probably think everything theyve been doing in between feb 2nd and yesterday was playing nice well if melvin wants to play that way fine ill be positioning myself to make out like a bandit if this thing never breaks $350 again say goodbye to what little liquidity remains its all gonna be mine ill even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow its yoinkin time she aint fallin under $200 again presqueeze somewhere in the range of $200250 seems to be the new floor this might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 5090 or maybe its because a shit ton of whales we dont even know about are sitting on massive limit buys should it drop again either way i think its pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while which is fine its a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly but since im gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200350 you better believe i got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50 and if it ever drops to or below $50 again im just gonna get reckless buying with real life money doubt this will happen though as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk and shorter term plans are gonna catch the hell out of any dips my business is picking up and my accountant verified what i am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code so game on gme shareholders will look more and more like a cult again this should come as no surprise last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 bad move baby and apes held together strong all the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded no matter what happens now even if it goes to $1share most of yall are gonna take those to your grave only way out is up and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become only this time im here drinking melvins milkshake with my verrrry long straw the squeeze will happen or i will own gamestop either one will happen or both will happen but it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen this strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching gme drop after feb 2 staring at every play retail investors could make and realizing the only people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers iv was high but the stock didnt move quite fast enough for puts to print selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares or even csps to result in a profitable outcome the way im playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally accelerated by the very shortsellerprofiting bullshit that went down feb 2nd to feb 22nd mark my words the only way i fail is if gme rockets past $350 between now and april and stays there tldr looks like its just s short sellers and hedge funds whales now get ready for stagnation in gme price high volatility sideways trading anything but up will help me accomplish my goal yall win or i win the only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers see yall from the boardroom edit positions currently holding both 1500 shares in rh most recent update 60 shares in fidelity previous update
136,37,2021-03-12 11:21:23,large scale orders vs price action today 311 x200b first i am not a financial advisor just an ape who has a fascination with crayons and honestly the first thing i saw when i looked at this screen was a nice big tasty green crayon after licking the phone screen a few times and realizing this was nonedible i figured i would screenshot this information to share with all of my crayonloving apefriends largescale orders are indicative of institutional investing so this gives us a tiny idea about what theyre up to were institutions buying in was melvin trying to start to cover was melvinco loading up on shares to sell off short profit from hedge with or what i then went back to stare at my lovely green crayon and noticed something quite distressing my crayon had shrunk after quickly checking my teeth for wax to ensure that i had not somehow managed to eat this green screencrayon i realized that the reason it shrunk was that large scale sell orders had just increased from $18m to $24m see arrows my brain got a wrinkle it itched and then i decided to check the stock chart around the time these screens were taken vertical lines at approx the times screenshots were taken would you lookie there a spike of sell volume all at once which drove the stock price down for a second ape was confused was it buy the peak and sell the dip or buy the dip and sell the peak ape was pretty sure dips were for buying not selling my brain wrinkled again it was annoying and then i noticed this selloff was the low of the day stoopid monke at a relative lowpoint around $260 seemingly trying to break the support level around $250 but it held stock slowly rose ape got distracted wandered away at market close i decided to check on my crayon again ape was distressed and then i remembered that i cant eat this crayon and calmed down i looked up and saw that largescale sell orders had increased to almost $39m meaning around $15m of largescale selling happened since i last checked on my crayon my brain itched again so i checked the stocks chart for the end of the day another spike in sell volume at around $260 which dropped the price to again test our support level around $250 ape doublechecked to make sure dips were for buying and not selling triple checked and confirmed selling dips bad then i remembered that gme is on the short sale restriction list today which means that melvin cannot aggresively short the stock theres no rule however that prevents them from buying up a bunch of stock and then selling it off all at once rapidly dropping the price of that stock hmmm brain is itchy at the end of the day it doesnt really look like melvin was buying up stocks to cover their short positions it looks like someone bought them just to sell them off to screw with the stock price but thats just my crayoneating hypothesis who knows what the hell is going on

438,92,2021-03-12 10:20:08,gme frequently closing in whole number evidence of manipulation through statistical analysis recently i started noticing something odd with gmes closing price with yesterday closing at exactly $265 and today at exactly $260 i pull some historical price and went to town in the past 29 trading days there were six closes resulted in whole numbers these whole number closing days only started after january 28th the day many brokers started placing restrictions on trading of meme stocks going back two years in history gme only closed in whole number once on october 23rd 2020 at $15 in two years leading up to january 28th 2021 the probability of close price resulting in whole number is 014 it can be explained away as a random event however 6 closes in 29 days is 207 in probability 5 you can no longer explain that with null hypothesis that means it was not random and we are seeing a statistically significant event x200b tldr gmes closing price is a clear indication that it is being manipulated we knew so but now statistics science confirms it edit added graph comparing closing price vs volume vs date with whole number closing days highlighted 
21,23,2021-03-17 12:26:38,gme fair value good evening apes and apetits hope you brought an appetite chew on this gamestops last fiscal year ended february 1 2020 in which they reported almost $200 million in cash flow on over $5 billion in revenue thats after a hard year but lets take it as a baseline a growth tech company with working capital and an aggressive business plan you can easily conceive rapid bottom line growth lets presume gamestop nets $1 billion in profit by the end of this year after applying a price multiple of 19 pretty modest then gme is fairly valued at wait for it exactly where it is now with a $19 billion market cap anyone with a longterm price target of less than where it closed today is staying blind on purpose this company aint dead it aint dying and it aint leaving and neither am i
46,46,2021-03-17 12:20:06,why institutional ownership is over 100 so i see a lot of people citing the fact that institutional ownership is currently over 100 im just a retard but i know some stuff and not all of it is banana related any stock ownership over 100 indicates that the stock is being shorted heavily that is because fake shares were somewhat created and sold by a short seller to another buyer now both the original owner and the new buyer of the stock can claim ownership of the same shares which effectively doubled the amount of shares being held for example i buy 1 gme share melvin capital borrows my one share to short sell and sells it to my friend bob now both bob and i can claim that we each own one share when in fact one of those shares is fake if i remember correctly the current institutional ownership of gme is 118 and the estimated retail ownership sits around 30 this means lots of fake shares exist all of this being said i have no idea what this means for anyone who is holding a fake share if the short position closes in theory for the overall ownership of the stock to drop below 100 and become a realistic number again shorts have to cover and return their borrowed shares there have been plenty of failures to deliver lately but no one seems to be doing anything about it my guess is that while short sellers have not increased their positions that have been diamond handing their short shares going as far as borrowing money to continue paying the hefty interest rates a brokerage likely would not margin call a short seller to buy back the position if they can keep coming up with interest money at this point it seems as if the only way for this to be over is if one side folds and closes its position whether the short sellers fold and buy their shorts first or the retail investors sell their shares is to be seen tldr im just a retard gme this is not financial advice edit some mentioned that holders dont pay interest which is true as long as the interest to short gme remains high those who hold should benefit in theory
0,36,2021-03-17 11:02:20,dips and strategy for rest of the week controversial post alert so as you beautiful apes already know this week has been quite eventful as compared to last friday my opinion theory when the wild dips started hitting gme we knew its hedgie scum as no apes are selling the attacks recently are getting more consistent why because the quadruple witching not guaranteed lift off date is approaching the hedgies want to kill momentum desperately as they want to turn quadruple witching into a dud pushing more apes to sell in a bid to avoid the ahem squeeze and pocketing all the money apes splashed on retarded otm calls as it stands they want the price to be at under $200 on march 19 to make all the calls expire worthless if the price goes beyond it may trigger a huge volume change prepping the ground for you know what the $200 price info comes from the bloomberg terminal posted here in this excellent post q what is bloomberg terminal a like bloomberg found a wsb sub on reddit it all makes sense now if you look at the history of attacks over the past few days today early ladder attack got the price down to $175ish after which they let their foot off the gas to save some ammo for the following days this is where the want the price to be throughout this week even at the end of ah trading they pulled the price back at $201 prepping to dip it under $200 tomorrow premarket x200b ok so whats your point the apes are holding idgaf what the shills here say we know that and we are keeping our end of the bargain and hodling but believe it or not the hedgie scum knows this well by scouring through this sub and capitalizing on us hodling i guarantee that they are shorting the stock each day everyday and making bank buying puts and collecting more ammo $$$ whats allowing this to happen is the predictability of retail traders they have seen our cards and are playing us and playing hard as much as we like to believe that they are curled up in ball and crying in their glass clad offices they are not they are devising new ways on making $$$ whether it be getting banks to create junk bonds big short shitadel ref x200b my strategy young apes and faint hearted should not read below this line i not we using my very own smoothest of the smooth brains fucked them in their own game already by doing my dd diamond handing my gme why not do it again play their game short your positions with their ladder attacks and buy gme back at a lower price point i did this today ended up $600 by selling at $217 and buying back at $205 put it back into gme for 3 more this play comes with an oath to myself to buy back my original position even in case my play goes sideways a small price to pay for salvation the hedgie attacks have also been quite predictable with one major attack per day bringing the price down followed by gme sawsawing between $20 range if i can predict it i can exploit it and pull freebies out of hedgie asses diamond handing means i buy atleast my daily starting position at end of the day if not more everyday remember our key play in gme is buy hodl not rebuying my position eod would be paper handing and i am not a bitch ass any other plays to fuck the hedgies even more 
1232,617,2021-03-16 06:17:06,gamestop is over thats right i said it if you apes dont evolve were all fucked youre all high on dopamine if you dont think we suffered a major loss on friday massive amounts of open interest was obliterated because we couldnt cross the 300 line it hasnt come back either grow some brain cells and google the open interest for 319 for your own damn self its not even half of what was there last friday were playing a high stakes game against some of the richest motherfuckers on this planet if you think all you have to do at this point is hold what you have we are absolutely and totally fucked the hedge funds are the loggers and the open interest is the amazon fucking forest guess what its on fucking fire you need to plant some fucking trees by buying as close to itm calls as you can and water those bitches with shares or theres going to be nothing left for the apes to live in you want to fight the big boys well the big boys have everything on the line when it comes to gme so they arent going to hold back you have rent to pay so we all understand why you dont go all in but how can we win if we wont theres one thing the hedge funds dont have that we do and it just might save our asses stimmy checks so what are you supposed to do with that stimmy buy shares sure but theres a better option if you paid attention to the first gme runup youd notice that we were putting all open options itm each and every day that meant that we were gamma squeezing every day we were a rolling boulder with no end in sight until rh fucked us all guess what this time we havent done that 1 single day yet do you know why its because you greedy ass smooth brained apes keep wasting money on $800 calls how the fuck are we supposed to gamma squeeze into $800 when there is a graveyard of open interest from 400700 the answer is we wont the hedges have us pinned so well because they know if we unlatch $300 we will unlatch $350 and $400 thanks to open interest unfortunately it stops there but it doesnt have to and dont worry about that until we get there we have to blowup the $300 wall to save gme from death and we have to do it soon so how do we break down $300 theres really only two things we can do and stimulus will greatly help us 1st hold what shares you do have if youre all in youre all in you just have to keep it up 2nd this is the most important buy the closest to itm or even itm call options that you can as these have much more effect on the priceshare of gme than shares do sub $450 is great but we really need $250$325 to get this thing rolling again if youre a whale looking to join the gme hypetrain this is how you do it 3rd whatever you can spare use to buy on the large dips dont wait them out the quicker we buy a dip back the more the hedges have to pay to reload their shorts what will happen you will see the hedges pull every trick out of the bag to slow the momentum the 290s will take some time but the strategy will work provided the capital is there if we can bring 800 itm then we are going to continue the trajectory set forth by the original gme surge stay strong apes positions 202 shares with intentions of putting stimulus into whatever call option i can afford
35,23,2021-03-14 13:56:36,how many funds account for the bulk of the short sellers we like to talk about hfs like theyre monoliths note to apes picture a giant shiny angular dildo but obviously there are lots of players working lots of angles in the gme saga my assumption is that retail investors arent doing a lot of short selling the hedge funds and investment banks are and they have untold billions in their fuckery budgets we have more individual investors they have more dollars but while i have a rough mental estimate of the size of the wsb crowd i have no sense of the number of institutional players recognizing that theyre all encrusted to their comeencrusted titties how many firms do you think are pursuing a strategy of heavily shorting gme are we up against ten firms 100 1000
613,140,2021-03-14 11:08:48,theta god of time and death i dont normally like these options for dummies kinds of posts and absolutely dont like seeing them but i keep seeing people try to make a stupid persons guide to how options work and being really irresponsible about explaining theta i have a few points i want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest im not going to talk about delta or iv thats a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read real quick not a pro not investment advice advice about how you need to actually learn shit if youre too retarded to understand basic math or youre too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now for the retards that stick around ill include pictures and a fun little story okay about 3 of you should be left so lets dive in theta the term theta refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time it can also be referred to as the time decay of an option this means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturity as long as everything is held constant theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an options value declines every day theta is an estimate of value decay its a rate thats continuously adjusted every second that passes makes your option worth less and less the biggest misconception is the one i want to focus on the most we talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day i think for our simple brains but its not that simple just like days arent really exactly 24 hours and theres complex reasons why theta is not linear you dickheads remember ymxb from middle school thats linear heres theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract x200b theta is exponential the theta decay on your option accelerates over time look at that last little sliver of the chart see how sharp it goes down thats fd range thats when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wifes interest in you when she met her boyfriend x200b theta will eat your lunch last week i had a c250 fd on gme that i had to close on a loss even though it was itm why because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that gme wasnt rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference buying otm and going itm is good but its important to understand that even if you are itm it still wont save you from theta and sometimes its smarter to take profit rather than waiting you could even take the profit and buy the underlying retardape edition incase youre somehow still here you live in loserville and want to move to tendietown the distance is 1000 miles you have 1 work week to get there 5 days so first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and youll get there on time great say you take monday off suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day not impossible but okay thats not a fun speed to move at take note its a 25 increase lets say again on the second day theres no movement now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days okay now youre looking at 3333 miles thats a 3333 increase from the previous day holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast but lets say for one reason or another you gary michael edward cant get out of bed on wednesday still have 1000 miles to travel now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day thats a 50 increase from the previous day and on the last day you need to do all 1000 which is a 100 increase from the previous day this is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across do you guys get it now every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time as the likelihood of the open hitting itm increases and time passes theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers dog walkers high school teachers please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors if someone tells you theyre not a pro are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you read a book motherfucker fds made this casino notorious because people who were here well before i was started posting crazy yolo fds who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns good luck everyone i know all you are going to pump fds with your stimmy so i guess just have fun and please try to learn how to read

49120,3064,2021-03-14 02:56:05,i teach high school which means i explain things to idiots every day if you still dont understand call options i got you i see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them so here you go note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified what is a call option basics a call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date example you buy a $400 call for gme that expires on march 19th what that means is that at any time between now and endofday on 319 you can buy 100 shares of gme for $400 if the price spikes to $700 dollars you can still buy them for $400 thats a pretty good deal so i need the price of gme to get to $400 to break even and anything above that is profit right not quite you have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money youre giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract the premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a $2 premium that means that you have to pay $2 per share of gme in the contract which means that you pay $200 the buy the call $2share x 100 shares you give the seller $200 and they give you the call option since you paid $200 for the option this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share why because if the price only got to $400 you could have bought it for $400share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste however if the price goes to $403share then you make a profit because you effectively paid $402share for a stock worth $403share but what if the price doesnt go up or even goes down do i have to still buy those shares for $400 no you never have to buy the shares if you dont want to remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400 but not the obligation but what if the price of gme goes way up but i dont have $40000 around to buy 100 shares at $400share then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40000 sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you dont need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is itm or in the money what does that mean lets look at some option vocabulary call option vocabulary strike price this is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract in our $400 call option above the strike price is $400 at any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400share for the stock exercise exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock in the example above you would spend $40000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stocks price at the time can i exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock no if you cant afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else expiration date this is when your call expires if you have a 319 expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after 319 premium the premium is the price you pay to the callseller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of 25 if you do the math it will cost you $25 which is 25share x 100 shares itm and otm in the money and out of the money itm calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price if you have a $400 call and the price of gme goes to $405 then your call is itm because you can buy a $405 stock for $400 if you then immediately sold the stock for $405 youd make money otm calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price if you have a $400 call and the price of gme is $350 then your call is otm it is important to realize that being itm doesnt mean being profitable in the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium if gme goes to $401 you are itm because 401400 but you havent broken even yet because your breakeven price is $402 fds fd is not an investment term and you dont need to know what it means in order to understand calls it is a wsb term and it stands for maggots delight but with an f because autmod wont let me define fds fds are otm calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble the guy who spent 90k on 1dte 1 day to expiration otm gme calls those were all fds and they all expired worthless why are they called fds because when you buy fds you usually end up taking it in the ass when people list their option positions they use a bunch of numbers and letters that i dont understand how do i figure out what theyre talking about you have probably seen something like this gme $400c 319 lets break it down gme $400c 319 the gme stands for gamestop which you probably figured out the $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400 if it said $400p it would be a put option but well talk about those later the 319 stands for the expiration date now lets make it more complicated if i said i bought 10 $5 gme $800c 319 what do i mean it means that i bought ten contracts of gme $800 calls with a 319 expiration and i paid $5 per share if i paid $5 per share how much did i spend on my contracts i spent $5000 $5share x 100 shares x 10 contracts now you try it a $700 call on gme that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share how would you explain to me that you bought two of them you would say that you bought 2 $7 gme $700c 319 now you can look like you know what youre talking about even though you still probably dont why do people buy call options this is confusing why do people even do this people buy call options because you can make a lot of money if you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price then for every $1 the share price goes above your breakeven price you make $100 if you have a $400c with a break even of $402 and the price gets to $412 then you make $1000 profit thats $10 of profit $412$402 times 100 shares you can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money it is usually better to sell the contract but thats not an important distinction because most of you cant afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts why are calls dangerous when you buy a stock at least you own the stock if you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing if the guy who bought 90k worth of fds had bought 90k worth of gme and held then hed still have somewhere around 90k worth of gme 5 depending on when he bought on thursday instead he has nothing why does the value of my call keep changing so you bought a call option and every time you look at it its worth a different amount of money thats because there are actually two types of value in an option options have intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is the exercisable value of the option if you own a $400c and the price is $412 then the intrinsic value of the option is $12share or $1200 because thats the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up pretty easy extrinsic value has a more complicated definition so were going to call extrinsic value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility for example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go itm because more time more chances for the price to rise therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go itm decreases this is called theta decay but you dont need to worry about that volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down theres a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you itm this is reflected in a measurement called iv or implied volatility like theta decay iv is a more advanced concept that you dont need to understand now as long as you get the basics due to the factors of time theta and volatility iv constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time this is why the value of your option will constantly change is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility your option value will decrease as iv drops is the stock starting to jump around your option value will increase as iv increases sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing why do you think that is if the stock value is increasing slowly but youre way otm and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i sell my contracts you can sell your contracts at any time you dont have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts this is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on there was a point yesterday when 90k fd guys 275 and 285 calls were itm when gme spiked to 290 if he had sold then he wouldnt have lost everything by waiting until expiration i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i exercise my contracts make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button they get your money and you get their shares this can take some time ok i get it but can you give me a tldr just in case i actually dont get it a call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price to buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller if the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit the end so im an expert now and can go yolo everything on calls and make money no you have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous dont go crazy buy a call see how it works for real dont yolo your life savings on your newfound knowledge or do live your life how you want im not your dad just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose
90,47,2021-03-14 02:25:05,an honest question about the muchhyped 323 gme earnings report please feel to correct me as i still have a few wrinkles and my brain hasnt smoothed over completely yet isnt this earnings report on 323 for the q4 results i see a lot of people convinced that this report is going to show a massive spike driven by the swell of support from the ape and online community but how much hype was there from consumers in the octdec range would we realistically reflect these gains on this next report or will we not really see them until the q1 report in three months x200b i just dont want people apes to have unrealistic expectations and for their hands to turn to paper if the actual results do not meet the hype x200b disclosure 2 gme 185 x200b edit thank you for the responses make sure to eat a banana today

44,54,2021-03-16 00:46:00,$skt the hybrid squeezecorona recovery play $skt in my quest to outretard the rest of you im always looking for the next big thing and after doing my own dd im convinced skt is the next one to lift off the skinny to summarize skt is an reit specializing in outlet mall space it has very high short interest 40 with a relatively low number of shares outstanding 90m one of the biggest short holders is our old pal melvin capital essentially skt is gmes downie brother who has been squirreled away to the back room to wonder why no one is paying him any attention lets give him some the thesis of those holding short positions is that retail is dying and that the rona was going to hasten its death that seemed like a reasonable hypothesis early on in the pandemic but that hypothesis has collapsed yet they havent closed their shorts early on in the pandemic a ton of stores closed down in april of last year only 1 of stores that had shut down had reopened as a percentage of occupied stores by june 3 56 had reopened and by jan 31 99 had in the q4 last year they were able to collect 95 of their usual payments their recovery has been amazing and were only just now starting to see people start to return to less cautious lifestyles the fact that they are outdoor outlets helps that proposition skt certainly faces some headwinds its in a challenging business during a challenging time much like our friends at gme but its not in such a terrible position to warrant 40 short interest a week or so we gave it a little squeeze a gentle caress really and it gave some ground it seems like if we were to reach around and use both hands this time with one firmly gripping the gamma wed really see it fly a $200 target has been thrown around here on wsb i feel like trying to put a certain number on it is just guesswork but i do feel like there is room for this to jump so you like beaten down retail plays with high short interest why not get in on the ground floor and buy the whole fookin mall $$skt$$skt position 7000 shares 416 $30c looking at some june calls not financial advice simply a page from the diary in my quest for billions or bankruptcy or both why not
70,56,2021-03-15 22:15:01,gimme your opinion on rkt play this week disclaimer not financial advice this is just something extra and i dont wanna shill rkt gme is still king however i wanted to run it by you guys and see if im not mistaken im thinking about buying rkt at market open and selling by end of weeki cant play options cuz europoor so the logic is this special dividend is on march 23rd and i dont think people wont sell until then so risk is minimal in general it could drop to 20 long term but i can take that risk open interest on call options is at 200000 otm call options at 30 and below even like 100000 more between 3050 if those calls get itm there could be a huge gamma squeeze as banks would need to hedge up to 30 million shares thats 30 of the float the problem rkt has a market cap of almost 50 billion however the float is only at 25 billion right now most shares are tied up with instutions and i think the ceo has like 75 of all shares dont hold me to those numbers but it looks something like that also as far as i understand the float consists of class ano voting power shares and the institutionsinsiders own mostly class dvoting power shares which are convertible to class a sharesim probably retarded and this isnt true so the question is do the banks and institutional investors who own most of the stock sell the options and already have the underlying or do the banks need to purchase the underlying from float and there giving the possibility of a gamma squeeze also are they able to just sell their shares thru options this way diluting the float i mean the option sellers would make money anyway because of premium yuge profit since they prolly bought at 20 tldr im betting on a gamma squeeze since float is only 23 billionhigh option activity problem is if option sellers already have the shares or need to purchase them to cover

128,16,2021-03-15 09:24:14,simplifying law dd series part ii nscc rules relating to their watchlist and margin here we go another entry into the series for my own amusement as i jot things down and attempt to make legal nonsense sense if you other apes gain a wrinkle or two too well thats just gravy part i here let me clarify first the point of this series is to grant a better understanding for us apes on how the nscc and dtcc does business or any other legal stuff for that matter relating to securities this is to prevent fud surrounding quotes of rules or rulings which when taken out of context seem like they wont help cause fear in the dtcc and co wont pay or find a way out of paying when the inevitable squeeze happens in addition to the new rule if you dont want to read my stuff just know the dtcc is and remains on the hook should a member default and they have so much credit cash and assets the squeeze will hurt but never finish them maybe anyway i had the thought that surely the nscc and therefore by extension the dtcc and sister companies doesnt just wait until the proverbial shit hits the fan or waits till the ass is primed in the fans direction after a spicy meal before it decides to protect itself big money likes to stay big money you may think well no shit but i doubt many of you know exactly how they do so this dd relates to what the nscc and co does before a member such as citadel or their family affiliates securities such as melvin default and enter rule 18 ie part i and defaults in addition to the new sld filing as always not financial advice do your own research and if that means you point to me and say stupid ape wrong im glad to hear it fling it at me onto the dd it actually relates to an amendment of rule which is thankfully 10 pages long the rule amendment im looking at file no srnscc2017010 relates to how the nscc detects funky trade moves from members and affiliates and determines margin payments remember the nscc handles the majority of clearing so they know whats been traded in the vast majority of cases the ficc also knows what theyre worth too so they can assess a member and any affiliates ability to settle their portfolio when things get hairy both from a portfolio and financial standpoint the nscc and ficc work together on this so the nscc has something called a risk matrix which helps them determine a members margin or a charge they have to pay into the nsccs clearing fund depending on how much risk their portfolio places the nscc under with respect to their positions and financial clout i cant shake the imagery that this rule is like members and their affiliates are aware the market is a simulation and get slaps on the wrist if they fuck with it whereas we apes are forced to play by the rules until we came along and ate the red pill that is gme when they were caught with their pants down i digress the clearing fund is the uh oh someone may default and we need to settle cash reserve and it is collected from all members even those on the right side of trades they just pay less but every member has to pay into it to protect the nscc the price of membership the difference is those more in risk pay more to account for their risky portfolio as i said the risk matrix extends to all members and affiliates and it represents a measurement like a credit rating to calculate the risk the nscc gathers up all their members portfolio info and the ficc tells them what each of their financial capabilities are an algorithm then determines a rating as an example youre potentially in the hole for $2b and you have a total assets and liquidity of $25b matrix sends alarm bells to the nscc of crap this members or this affiliate is in the shit scrape some money now or itll hurt you later a good member may get aaa rating if their risk is nowhere near what theyre worth so a token donation from you further if you find yourself on the nscc watchlist well your margin payment is going to increase too those on the watchlist are essentially those with a bad credit rating in the eyes of the matrix who either continue or increase in that position or else have failed to raise enough capital to balance their risk relative to their assets or both this rule specifically brings in affiliate investments likely so risky positions cant be held in such entities without risk an aside could this be why citadel invested in melvin its speculative but imagine youve lost billions and then youre slapped with a fat margin bill as you cant exit the position or else default seems like a great time for a predatory institution to come in and grab your shares at discount prices just saying so how does this relate to the situation well as part i described you want to avoid defaulting as much as possible or else your ass gets liquidated speculation now imagine youre a melvin whos lost billions and doesnt have the capital to front the charge for your risky position you then default and your ass gets liquidated and thats you done out the market citadel steps in and invests in you so you can sell out your risky positions to them and you can legally say you closed out your position and their assets make the charge less because your position in the matrix is better as youre better capitalized next you try and tank the stock but it doesnt work citadel then has the increased charge for their position with each day that goes by the current sld is measured against the last 24 months trading and the investment into melvin you can hide as it wasnt your investment but youre eating a lot of money in interest the longer this goes on for higher prices the quicker youre done when the sld rules come into place and the nscc demands a larger sum of what you can handle when the rule change passes you default and they settle you out the incentive is only to keep kicking the can down the road and pray retail gets bored as both of you are done if this doesnt happen which it wont if apes hold tldr this situation for melvin and citadel is like being stuck in an underwater cave and finding an oxygen tank from another trapped person sure youll last longer but that canister will run out eventually and youre done
105,18,2021-03-15 08:10:37,dtcc rulemaking timeline other sleep aids tldr the new dtcc rules for short sellers almost certainly arent going into effect before march 19thinstructions for how to submit a comment are included at the end im not a securities lawyer or sec savant or even a particularly wrinklebrained ape but ive read the dtcc proposed rules on liquidity requirements and short sellers and some affiliated communications and i think some wsb recordstraightening is needed first a public comment period is almost always required for any federal rules changes sec or its affiliates may be exempt from this for some reason and i cant tell from the materials themselves so hopefully a smarter ape than me can offer comment until i hear otherwise im going to assume that this is like every other federal rulemaking and the comment period is public and will last 30 days minimum im including directions for how to submit comments at the end pasted directly from dtccs important notice on the proposed rule changes if you have a strong opinion about these rules the public comment period would be the time to voice it whats the actual timeline for the new rules imo the more important of the two rules 801 lists an implementation timeframe that can be found on page 19 of 79 of the srnscc2021801 filing v implementation timeframe nscc would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 business days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice and approval of the related proposed rule change by the commission nscc would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by important notice posted to its website note the related proposed rule is srnscc2021002 and afaik has not been approved either i believe this passage is the source of the 10 days timeline i have seen elsewhere however by my read this is saying two conditions must be met before the 10 business day countdown can begin 1 a no objection is filed associated with this rule and 2 srnscc2021002 is also approved once both happen that essentially gives everybody two weeks to prepare make changes etc but before we start marking any close dates on the calendar ask yourself do i really think there will be no objection to this to be clear no objection is a term of art once again im not a lawyer or sec expert but i assume objections can come from the leaders at sec the board of governors of the federal reserve system and presumably other federal political leaders including house and senate financial services committees the list of people who could object might also include though i hope not industry lobbyists or trade association heads i dont know again if you know this please comment and ill update why does this matter im not a big fan of fixating on specific dates for things like short squeezes the market is huge and complex and there are literally millions of people doing their part to influence it in lots of different ways but if youve got dates in mind and theyre coming up soon imo you are safer and probably better off assuming this dtcc rulemaking process will not be complete and the new rules will not be in effect how do i submit a comment the dtcc important notice directs comments to secs internet comment form here when you click through though youll see thats not actually a form but a list of sec affiliated organizations ordinarily i would expect to find the national securities clearing corporation nscc proposed rules on the nscc proposed rule page but neither of these is listed there so you may need to skip the sec internet comment form and go straight to sending an email to rulecommentssecgov here are the instructions for submitting a comment from dtccs letter on srnscc2021002 srnscc2021801 the full text of the filings may be obtained by visiting the dtcc website at written comments on the filings may be addressed to national securities clearing corporation co general counsels office 55 water street new york new york 10041 attention jacqueline chezar executive director and associate general counsel and your comments will be forwarded to the sec you may also address your written comments to the secretary of the commission securities and exchange commission 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 electronic comments may be submitted using the secs internet comment form or by sending an email to rulecommentssecgov please include file numbers srnscc2021002 and srnscc2021801 on the subject line we request that you provide nscc with a copy of your comments questions regarding these filings or this important notice may be addressed to jacqueline chezar executive director and associate general counsel at 2128553216 if you read this far youre probably as confused as i am 540 gme long
6195,843,2021-03-15 07:15:12,sup apetards ive been doing some technical analysis recently fractals and shit and found out that geemeeee is going to fking penetrate $1k next week hope you enjoy the read yeah you heard it right and you most likely know that already but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen the analysis is build upon fractal techniques so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast buckle up and eat a crayon fellow trader the word is used as anagram you know for what as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading and it might even help you with the digestion of the information in the post this is not a financial advice and i am not and a professional advisor i just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally but why do i need your fartcal analizis1 well thats a good question when i was a young ape living free in the steppes of kazakhstan jk leave poor vlad alone for a moment the fractal from latin fractus means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data the trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern formed by a sequencees of candles which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and timeframes fractals are simple yet important repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend apely speaking fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument now that the captain is gone lets get to business gme fartcals wroom wroom i know that you all love crayons with all of your hearts so i will use rare turquoise and magenta ones in this analysis furthermore i did my best to simplify the method of distinguishing the fractal sequences using simple lines and hopefully you should need no more than one brain wrinkle to understand it what you see on the chart one candle represents 2 hours of price action above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals the chart starts from the 11th of january with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse 1416 jan followed by another turquoise consolidation this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days next is where the things really start to get interesting 22nd jan as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially this accelerection does not go quietly erupting into a powerful gap not as big as the one in your head though finally starting 27th of jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex pay attention to this peak as it will be used for calculations later on the 27th of january what why purple rectangle you may ask easy rektangles are the horsemen of the endgame that was only the left part of the chart now lets be brief for a moment there were six main components to the fractal base turquoise consolidation magenta uptrend turquoise consolidation 2 magenta impulse gap and purple rectangle what you see on the right is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother particularly starting 22nd feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests and this is how we really utilize fractals identify the fractal sequence from the previous data on the left and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions on the right many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph dont they coincidence i think not oh fartcals good butt wen moon1 here you go boy allrighty i know that the energy from the crayon you ate is running out so lemme summarize the analysis for this intellectually limited individual with extraordinary small brain capacity that you are what i need you to do now is what even a half brained chimpanzee is capable of count to six yes you may use your fingers twice numbers and fractals simplified for dummies 1 flat line 2 small magenta hill 3 line as flat as your wifes girlfriends tit 4 accelerection 5 your brain aka gap 6 valhala rektangle gme go bbbbrrrrrrr good boygirl youve come this far now that your confirmation bias is reinforced you may get some rest or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend because we are diving deeper ok it turned out that i needed to eat some crayons myself because i really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row so i ate a pack this time and i am full of gmenergy as is the chart below so bullish that we will definitely see some gmenergy explosions in a short time to come now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit but the apes have to evolve at one point in history so i really encourage you to use this opportunity indepth fractal forecast i hope that you got accustomed to the previous six steps for dummies explanation and by this moment you should understand the basic principle of how the fractals play what you see above is a little bit more advanced chart through which i aim to explain how i came to the price predictions in the post title finally ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable where did a b come from the first and most important notice is that ab fractals are built upon 123456 and on the chart you can see that a measures 1234 pattern while b covers 56 steps of the sequence ab on the left january run is self explanatory the fractals are measured as they are ab on the right current price action formation is where we need some math to get involved particularly when we are working with the new b movement prediction and that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance again the main fractal property reoccurrence will play on our side predicting the price movements on a volatile market like this one is one of the most ungrateful things to do so dont go too harsh on what i am going share with you apesters my theory is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move using data from previous one and here we only need the coefficient from first ab move a simple ratio dividing first b move about $325 increase by first a move $131 gives us a coefficient of about 248 lets apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal that is multiplying the second a fractal completed height about $330 based on my prediction which is built later in this post which will give the estimated b part of the second fractal height of about $818 landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week boom looks beautiful and promising fractals baby i hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far smoothiebrainie but there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed particularly it is the the sequence part number 4 where the price action stands currently and yeah you guessed it almighty fractals are helping us here again below you will find two charts both are 30 min charts which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above i cant stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why gme price action 2227 january gme price action 515 march because they look similar again now i will ask you to excuse me i started to work on this analysis about ten hours ago and i really need to get some sleep as my brain is holding strong to the last wrinkle it has left so this explanation will be brief i forecasted the apex point of the current 4 using not so complicated method and again taking inspiration from the previous price action and its underlying patterns the magenta curly lines play as supports for both of the impulses and these look amazingly similar in its slope and pace but we should probably stop being surprised about that at this point the second important fractal factor is this chainsaw in the middle of the patterns corresponding to the severe corrections in these bull runs remember being in the market at those moments wooh that was fun and finally take a look at this averaged line that looks like a string of a bow not only it averages the price action it also completes this bow shaped fractal pattern allowing us to predict the potential high of the current price action $380ish thats it folks mic drop tldr fractals is life fractals is love as is geeemeee

216,22,2021-03-15 01:07:25,stockdale paradox balance optimism and realism dont assign dates when things will get better but dont lose faith that they will ive seen this encouraging sentiment come up a bit more here regarding the gme squeeze the biggest disheartening factor is people sayingbelieving the squeeze will come on __day of next week or on the date of month what happens is that day passes and its just another reason to paperhands it reminded me of the stockdale paradox so i figured id post it you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the endwhich you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be james stockdale yeah its hokey but those that assign a date to their rescue are going to be more likely to bail or break when that date comes and goes even though they are just as sure it will come as someone who believes but doesnt assign a date do yourself a favor and believe your own conclusions however you come to them but dont kid yourself with an exact date or range of dates no one knows and even if theres the strongest evidence there have been shenanigans in the past and theyll come again
3087,241,2021-03-15 01:00:09,i explain things to idiots part 2 puts and a couple clarifications about calls yesterday i made a post explaining calls which you can find here in it i said id explain puts later its later so im explaining them below i also had a lot of people ask me further questions about selling calls so after i talk about puts im going to cover some of that info to clear up confusion assuming this goes as well as the last one maybe ill do one more post about options in which ill talk about writing callsputs and maybe go into a little more detail about the greeks and how options are priced and valued well see moving forward if you didnt read yesterdays post then the first thing you should do is read that because im going to use terminology and refer to concepts that were explained in that post what is a put option if a call is a bet that that a stock is going to go up then a put option hereafter referred to as a put is a bet that a stock is going to go down like a call a put is contract involving 100 shares however instead of giving you the ability to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price a put option gives you the ability to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price example lets say that gme is trading at $300 and you think it is going to tank you can buy a put option for $100 and if the price of gme drops below $100 youre itm how do puts work the same way as calls you buy them the same way you pay for them the same way premiums you sell them the same way if you dont want to exercise more on this later as selling your contracts was the most common question i got yesterday and they are impacted by theta decay and iv the same way one key difference is the exercising of a put option which well look at in a second other than that there isnt much more to put here if you understand calls then you understand puts beyond exercising the only real difference is that you are betting on the price to go down instead of up can you give me an example anyway i was lying when i said i understood calls sure lets say that gme is trading at $300 and you think the the hedgies are winning and the squeeze is over or maybe you think that the squeeze is going to squoze next week and after that the price is going to drop once everyone takes their profits regardless by 326 you think that the price will drop back down to $40 or lower so you buy an $832 gme 100p 326 do we remember what that means and how much it costs it means you spent $832 for the right to sell 100 shares of gme for $100 on or before 326 now you wait if 326 comes and goes and the price never drops then your option expires otm but if you were correct and the price does drop below $100 then you are itm and have a choice to make you can sell the contract or exercise it ok so how is exercising a put different than exercising a call if you choose to exercise a call you have one option buy the shares when exercising a put you have three options 1 if you already have 100 shares of gme maybe you missed the peak and are holding a bag then exercising the put is as easy as making the option writer buy your shares you give them 100 shares of gme and they give you $10000 $100share x 100 shares 2 if you dont have 100 shares of gme then you can buy 100 shares for whatever the stock price is if it dropped all the way to $40 then youd buy them for $40 and then sell them to the option writer for $100 share thats dumb dont do that 3 if you think it has farther to fall and you have a margin account you can enter a short position you borrow 100 shares and sell them to the option writer for $100 then you wait and buy them back later to replace the shares you borrowed thats big dumb dont do that either really though you should be selling your contracts instead of exercising because exercising contracts throws away any extrinsic value you may have built see below plus you probably dont want and cant afford 100 shares of whatever stock you have options on the part where i talk about selling your option contracts and answer some common questions and hopefully do a better job than last time im going to talk about puts and calls both here first lets talk about value and taking advantage of that value to sell for profit we talked about this a little yesterday but you need to make sure you understand that your option has value from when you buy it until it expires and that you can use that value to make money does that mean it has value even when its otm yes even otm options have value see extrinsic value from yesterday why because people buy otm contracts in fact otm contracts can even make you money while still otm did you buy a $400c when the stock price was $100 if the stock price gets to $350 you may be otm but your $400c contract can be worth more now than it was when you bought it assuming there is time left before expiration and theta isnt killing you but how can you buy an otm contract and then sell that same contract for profit when it is still otm remember the premiums when people buy options they pay the option seller a premium to buy that contract the premium on a way otm contract is going to be very cheap the premium on a near the money contract that is that has time to spare is going to be higher if you buy that contract when it is way otm and sell it when it is near the money the price the buyer gives you could be higher than the price you paid to the seller which equals profit the same is true of a put if you buy a $100p when the share price is $400 youll be able to sell that contract for a profit if the price drops to $150 again assuming you arent running out of time time is a big deal seriously ill talk about that later on the other hand an otm option that is running out of time and not even close to strike or hasnt move appreciably since bought isnt going to have as much value as it did when you bought and any sale would be at a loss but remember that you can still sell it even if it is losing itm options always have value because they are worth the difference between the stock price and strike remember intrinsic value which cant be zero if the stock is trading above strike so when can i sell my contract anytime you can sell it itm otm or atm at the money which means the stock is trading at the strike price i dont think we talked about atm options yesterday are you approaching expiration and the stock is trading sideways and you dont think youre going to hit the strike before time runs out you can sell it and cut your losses did the stock spike deep itm but you think its going to crash back down sell that thing and realize some profit who determines the price of a contract who determines the premiums do i set the premiums when i sell my contract the premiumvalue of a contract is determined by an arcane combination of factors including time to exercise strike price stock price volatility and others there is a lot of greek involved there may be actual magic involved too either way the price is set for you and you dont have to worry about it but whos going to buy my contract if nobody ever wants to execute then who ends up with all the calls if nobody has shares to sell who ends up with all the puts i was surprised at how many people asked me this question the short answer is that it doesnt matter someone will buy your contract the medium answer is that it could be individuals institutions or the market maker absorbing the trade if no one else will regardless callsputs that werent offset will be exercised by some entity or other in the case of calls if they didnt want the shares theyll just sell them in the case of puts if they didnt have the shares to sell then theyll buy them if i sell my contract to someone else am i on the hook when they exercise no the writer or the person who created the contract and first sold it is the only person who will be on the end of an exercise if you write a call that goes itm then you can get assigned and have to cough up some shares if you bought a call and then sold it when it went itm then you dont have to sell any shares to cover if you want to learn about writing callsputs then maybe ill do that next time what if i dont sell my itm option when it expires it depends on the brokerage and whether or not you have a margin account your brokerage will either exercise them sell the contract for you or let it expire so what is the deal with time then or when should i sell my contract time which is referred to and measured as theta plays a big part in the extrinsic value or potential as we talked about yesterday of an option the closer you get to expiration the faster theta decay the loss of value due to time is going to increase and the faster you are going to start losing value in fact there can be instances in which the stock price goes up but your option value still goes down because theta decay is eroding value faster than the other pricing factors are increasing value for this reason you generally dont want to wait until expiration to sell a call and should have a plan to do so earlier theta decay is real so when is earlier there are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell in conclusion if you think a stock is going to go up buy a call if you think its going to go down buy a put sell your contracts dont exercise them dont wait until the last minute you have nothing to lose but your chains premiums thats most of what i can think of to say about the basics of buyingselling options is there more to it than that yes but adding it in here will make it too long and too technical and more articles that are too long and too technical arent going to help people who are struggling to get the basics as i said above i might do one last options post about writing contracts and maybe covering the greeks well see regardless it wont be today or tomorrow maybe next weekend i hope this all was helpful

18549,1229,2021-03-16 13:12:57,$gme how the dip today was due to etf shares being lent out over 35million dd  welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again i was asked to write up the recent relation between etfs and the gme dips weve been witnessing in the last several trading days i have included a tldr for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2monthold dog also due to wsb guidelines i am unable to mention these etf tickers due to their market cap please bear with me not the anyone questions feel free to dm and ill respond in 1015 working days jk hedge funds covering up $gme shorts through etf cloaking i would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly exchangetraded funds etf an exchangetraded fund etf is a type of security that tracks an index sector commodity or another asset but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock an etf can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities etfs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies you can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds short selling short selling is the process of selling shares that you dont own but have instead borrowed likely from a brokerage most people short sell shares for two reasons 1 they expect the share price to decline shortsellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit 2 they want to hedge or offset a position held in another security for example if you have sold a put option an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security authorized participants an authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchangetraded fund etf they provide a large portion of the liquidity in the etf market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an etf when there is a shortage of etf shares in the market authorized participants create more likewise as etf borrow costs increase aps are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position and more likely to failtodeliver in a typical transaction the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102 to 105 of the shares value in cash government securities or a bank letter of credit if the etf needs to sell the stock it can recall it from the borrower but if the borrower for any reason isnt able to deliver the shares the etf is repaid through the collateral instead although that can have adverse tax consequences for the etf $gme relationship lets look at the past trend of an etf with gme now im not claiming todays red day was entirely due to etfs being shorted or their shares being lent out but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors x200b notice how the assets plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze x200b by law a fund can have no more than onethird of its total assets in securities on loan few etfs or other funds ever reach that ceiling and etfs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds market makers are continually creating new etf shares by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the etf and redeeming others and getting the underlying securities in return so the number of etf shares outstanding fluctuates because the supply isnt fixed there really is no impact on performance when an etf is net short industry participants say the prices of etf shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings etf shares borrowed today saw significant lending suspicious isnt it credit to uhkzor for providing these images x200b x200b etf 1 65m available last week to 4m today x200b x200b etf 2 13m available last week to 850k today x200b x200b etf 3 900k last week to 500k today just taking into account three etf lendings you could see 335 million shares were borrowed in todays trading session short sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure coupling it with highfrequency machines being used the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as weve been witnessing for the past few trading days the hfs have most likely synthetically shorted gme via etfs to drive its price down since then they can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs and theres concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before when coupled with synthetic longs via options gives the appearance of shorts covering when they havent takes gme off the threshold security list when it shouldnt be and provides the ability to naked short gme again this was the missing piece of how gme could actually be shorted without appearing so this solves the nyse threshold securities issue and the ability to drive gme down outside of buying a put ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another if the etfs recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel given they are still paying massive si without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index the link between failure to delivers and etfs etfs are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25 of us equity trading volume therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific etfs are directly linked to gme the ones i used as evidence is either because $gme is a major part of their portfolio or the etf is retail orientated failure to deliver a condition where two investors agree to the purchasesale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner x200b the daily volume of failure to deliver traded in the past x200b etfs being shorted in the past x200b comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in failure to deliver has had a direct correlation with etf volume being shorted point being the finance industry has used etfs as a way of covering up their failure to delivers way before $gme authorized participant arbitrage option operational shorting when faced with excessive buying pressure as we have witnessed with $gme authorized participants and market may sell shares as naked and then locate or create the shares at a later time up to t6 for bona fide market making however delaying past t3 results in a failure to deliver but apmarket makers are allowed to fail past t3 because they are making markets and have an additional three days to settle trades a total of t6 this choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay i wont go too indepth about options hedging in this post because i want to keep the topic on the point of etfs however i see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread tldr do not worry about the price decreasing this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending etf shares and recent data proves that over 35 million shares were lent out through etfs yesterday and their failure to delivers are accumulating each and every day its like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card does it solve the issue no it only delays it and makes it worse secondly there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread fud people who cheer for gme being put on the shortlist need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge

795,107,2021-03-16 11:15:20,hang in there they are hurting there is clearly manipulation going on otherwise the stock wouldnt have had these massive spikes down the majority of people buying are holding for a squeeze some may be day trading but day trading implies buying back anyway so you have to ask yourself why are the hfs maniplating the market like this you also have to ask yourself why they shit the bed and deleted the buy button when the first spike hit 400 the only answer is that they cannot afford to see gme not only go up but stay up a drowning person will fight back hardest just before drowning hang in there
161,57,2021-03-16 11:01:53,short melvin and citadels portfolio it has become apparent through recent events that the fate of citadel and melvin capital are inextricably linked one might even say melvin capital is a thinly veiled shell company for citadel to spread its holding positions and reduce risk of full exposure in the event of a catastrophic market event gme mother of all short squeezes for example citadel and melvin will be forced to liquidate their most valuable long positions for melvin capital this would start with expedia their largest portfolio holding by percent and totaling $15b in current market value x200b interestingly enough expedia is currently trading at alltime historical highs near $170share with a recent nasty pullback in january of this year to $120 range expedia average daily volume is only 35 million and a share float of 113 million this means melvin capitals total expe long position is 10 of the entire expe public share float if melvin capital were to suddenly divest a portion of its expedia holdings the short term price of expe would capitulate downward potentially triggering other institutional holders to also reduce their expe exposure i have nothing against expedia but their recent share price run up combined with an institutional delevering event as proposed above could make for a significant pullback
2154,135,2021-03-16 09:56:25,pricing mechanics or how i learned to stop worrying and love gmes dips listen up fellow smoothbrained apes i get it ending the day in the red sucks it can also take an emotional toll if you allow but there is something about gme pricing that ive seen a few people mention but not go into depth explaining and its pretty freaking important to understand first the value of currency goods or services is only worth the value you place upon it if thats not ape enough for you banana worth whatever ape want repeat the above a few times and let it sink in this is not an oversimplification its a fundamental of economics everyone is conditioned from the time they are a baby ape to trust what they are told something costs ever since you got your first allowance if you were lucky so you could learn the value of money youve been conditioned to think a good or service is worth what other people tell you think about it you go to the store to buy a pack of gum thatll be $1 and you say okay if you say so or as an ape you go to the store to buy a banana thatll be $1 and you grunt banana good rinse and repeat for the majority of things apes buy without question over time apes will start assigning intrinsic value to currency based on the pricing they see over and over for goods and services this is why uncool boomers complain all the time about how a soda cost 5 cents back in their day people become conditioned to expect x costs $y thats deep but what does this have to do with stocks as some wrinkly brained apes get smarter they may not take everything at face value and instead shop around for sellers with a better deal on that banana basically finding someone who assigned the same value to the good or service as them when and if that occurs they are both happy and willing to conduct the trade it goes both ways if you have a banana to sell you want to find the ape willing to pay the most in the most simple sense this is the market buyers and sellers are continuously trying to find each other in the market but driving around in apemobiles across the country to find the perfect match is a pain in the ass this is where marketplaces come into the picture a marketplace is a venue physical or virtual that serves to connect buyers with sellers its a great racket to be in as those who operate the marketplace typically take a cut of every trade sound familiar ebay amazon nyse because for most apes its worth not driving around to find the best price on 1 banana i already know what is a marketplace maybe so but let me connect the dots the purpose of the marketplace is to match apes __willing__ to trade at the __same price__ in stock market terms this is bid and ask prices so if one ape is willing to buy a banana for $1 and another ape is willing to sell a banana for $1 and thats the best price for both a marketplace like nyse matches them up automatically to conduct the trade lets take a theoretical case of a stock that has only 1 share 1 buyer and 1 seller if the buyer enters a limit order of $100 and the seller enters a limit order of $200 no trade will occur those orders will just sit there and do nothing in stock market terms this is trade volume and in this case its a big fat zero every minute of trading hours what if both apes had set their limit buysell orders for $150 the marketplace nyse sees hey these two apes agree on a price let me just conduct that trade for you this happens in a split second given computers are continuously looking at the backlog of buyers and sellers waiting to match this backlog is also known as market depth or level 2 trading information bonus brain wrinkle if either ape had set a market order instead of a limit order the nyse would automatically conduct trade at whatever price the other ape set this is why market orders are probably not what most apes want to do you never know who else might show up with a price you dont agree with come on already what is your point now that everyone reading this should have the same understanding of the marketplace nyse at this point lets discuss how volume has an impact in the example above i use 1 buyer and 1 seller once their trade executed it was a volume of one if both buyer and seller had their limits set to $150 the nyse would reflect a stock price of $150 simple enough right but what if there were 10 potential sellers with a share 9 of which are diamondhanded apes but 1 of those was a hedgehog and wanted to drive down price we already know the 9 apes value their shares at $1m and are not __willing__ to sell for the __same price__ that the buyer is bidding $150 lets say the nyse shows the last trade price as $420k all it takes is for that one hedgehog to put in a sell order for $150 and bam nyse then shows the last trade price as $150 not the $1m that the 9 other apes value the stock to be this is because nyse did what is supposed to do and match a buyer and a seller that agreed on the same price preposterous market manipulation the apes scream as they start throwing shit around their cages unfortunately as a result 1 of those apes may become paper hands after their primitive visual cortex lights up seeing $150 on nyse and triggers a prehistoric behavior that says banana worth what other ape tell me it worth and starts mashing the sell button well good job you stupid ape you let 1 hedgehog tell you what you think your share is worth and therefore made it a reality ignoring the 9 other apes that think its worth $1m youve been conditioned your whole life to let a sticker price tell you what something is worth and havent evolved pathetic so the last trade price on nyse isnt really what the stock is worth no whether it be 10 apes or 10 million apes nyse is not going to reflect what the other apes value the shares to be the last trade price is exactly that the __last trade__ this is why trade volume is so important anything less than 1m volume can easily affect the last trade price but thats not the value of the shares repeat with me the last trade price is not the value of the shares tldr the hfs know that apes are conditioned to think money has value share prices dont reflect what people think its worth they only reflect the __last trade__ the hfs also know they can easily manipulate the __last trade__ price on low volume the hfs are screwed as long as apes dont let nyse ticker tell them what they should value the shares to be disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and i am not a cat im only sharing my knowledge of economics to help others understand that all is not as it seems in the world edit some words

202,53,2021-03-17 06:35:05,nok dd  i am not a financial adviser and your own dd must be carried out prior to trading this stock nokia corporation nok market cap $242bn 52 week range $234 to $979 this is no longer the company that produced mobile phones and its a while 8 years since they moved away from phones when selling the whole division they are a seamless 5g platform supplier in fact they are one of only two companies anywhere with the capability to supply a continuous end to end 5g network platform the other company is huawei i shall not swear any more the only issue with nokia is that they are not forthcoming and the information released to the public very much underplays how well the company is progressing previously the opposite approach this has artificially boosted the share price but as the business moves forward this is holding the share price downand for a very good reason i have come to suspect that from several conversations with people i know at large institutions who avoided talking about nokia at all costs that some large positions are being built up stealthily previously such avoidance of talking about companies has resulted in sec filings showing large purchases during the previous quarter this may be the reason why they didnt dip too far below $4 during the recent market drop back to where nokia is really at about 88 of revenue comes from wireless network infrastructure and products and internet routing equipment 10 years of acquisitions have seen the transformation into a leading wireless technology company in 2016 the takeover of alcatellucent which included bell labs this made them into a potential giant along side the h company and ericsson powering its asicpowered base station and 5g platform with its new artificial intelligence reefshark semiconductor saves around 50 energy usage and makes the product cheaper to customers this product is the ideal solution for mobile virtual network operators there are between 800 and 1200 worldwide when software development catches up the big tech and social network companies will have their own wireless service running autonomously there is potential in cities to bring a network up to an astounding capability of over 5tbps yes terabytes that means each loop can have 5000 customers with 1gbps service reefshark makes nokia the top of the pile in this massive coming market and unlike ericsson its all in house and no need for partners the h company is banned from a number of significant countries so nokia is ideally placed to pick up that business nokia are stripping fitter by reducing operating costs and will shed a few thousand jobs this could save $500m a year at $430 the shares are cheap apart from a few shrewd institutions nokia is currently ignored by most of the wall street sharks its typical of the attitude towards an overseas based company the institutions that have got the jump on building up their stake in nokia will be celebrating by the end of the year when the rest of wall street wants a piece of the action $8$10 is what i am expecting the price has crept up every day for the past week and could gather more momentum as the company gets a real grip on their business it all looks good to me position i sold it all for gme edit 
126,34,2021-03-17 02:07:31,a lurkers appreciation post retirement account all in ive been watching and participating in this spectacle since late january i havent been posting i lurk on reddit i dont post i do read however despite having the comprehension of an ape the content ive been consuming the personal stories the wrinkledbrain analysis the memes has been amazing this truly is a unique community its global inclusive and by and large supportive its a great resource for those like myself who have jumped into the market with little understanding gamestop piqued my interest this community has helped refine that interest into understandingwell maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of whats going on so as an ape who has been lurking and learning i thank all you apes from cornelius to zaius from grodd to solovar and of course king kong himself dfv you apes run the spectrum and are on the spectrum youve helped me the ape from 2001 a space odyssey i think its an ape though maybe a neanderthal apes cant remember details from films gather my first investment tools on a related note i put my retirement account into gme pretty high cost basis no not considering whats going to happen in the near future its gonna be bananas 
106,21,2021-03-17 00:56:10,gme simulation for the next wave lads good morning yall ive been studying the chart for a long time regarding to the current prices and data available as i noticed that this drop is good so far to sustain the supply and demand in any trend in gme situation its an uptrend ofc but to sustain the trend some pullbacks to reaccumulate and gaining more buying power before the next surge x200b the yellow bold box is feb range did you see how the price touched the high then fall back this fall back i believe will find a support at white little box 150$ 100$ at that range also to added trend line to determine the next possible wave range i think it would be at 1400 3500$ if somehow the price broke that level then the short squeeze has to be happen later on it would be almost impossible for short sellers to stop the surge unless if sec intervene well im not expert in the american rules but everything is possible in gme situation lastly this pullback isnt done yet i expect the price will keep falling until it find a decent support im not a financial advisor i just like to draw lines and nonsense ta
433,72,2021-03-17 00:22:45,3162021 gme open interest report im an idiot this is just data that may be useless this isnt financial or legal advice for entertainment purposes only tldr the option shorts are pulling out all the stops to keep the price down because they are fucked on the options side of things at certain levels after $300 it starts getting really bad really fast for them and it spirals out of control added per comment here is todays open interest report and total exposure for weeks with significant open interest as of market open and based on fridays closing price of 22014 oi data is not real time we only know oi after close posting here for the first time if you like it and it doesnt get blocked ill continue posting here as well as my other board for the background of this post and all of the weaknesses of this stupid analysis scroll down to the end for all open contracts at close of business yesterday and yesterdays closing price of 22014 total exposure decreased to $2546 billion down from $3084 billion yesterday 87 of that exposure is tied up in the options shown in the figures and tables expiring friday $925 million 416 $691 million 716 $306 million and 12122 $288 million see figure 1 and table 1 in terms of actual shares needed to cover short options that are in the money our hypothetical single actor will need to find 115 million shares of gme or their equivalents to cover their positions across all open itm positions this is approximately 21 of the float of gme and 16 of all shares outstanding see figure 2 and table 2 this is down from 148 million shares needed to cover yesterday x200b limitationsweaknessesbackground this is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question if a hypothetical single actormarket maker was on the short side of all open options in gme which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself what would that single actors exposure be in terms of dollars how many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions note that this does not represent this market makers loss to sell an option this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position also it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasingselling shares on the open market to cover short positions finally a major weakness of this curiosity is that by its nature it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything in reality we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders
2917,494,2021-03-17 03:33:29,gme has anyone considered this possibilitycohen ace in the hole so ryan cohen originally purchased his 129 stake in gamestop at $843 per share average based on the current price this is about a 2300 profit per his contract as a board member he cannot own more than 20 of the company leaving him with 71 company stake remaining he is able to purchase or roughly 3900000 shares so lets say he sits and waits till this friday when mms continue to move the price toward 155 current calculated max pain price for options on 319 he then files a 13f and buys up 39 million sharesthis would still put his profit average well over 1000 and would blow mms attempts to pin the price out of the water triggering a gamma squeezethis creates massive margin calls by tuesday 323 which coincidentally happens to be when gme reports earnings the convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum could be enough to then trigger the moass imo thoughts not financial advice i like the stock
258,52,2021-03-17 14:29:05,as fun and exciting it has been watching this fiasco unfold so far its also equally frightening and a shame although ive only got 6 shares in this gme roller coaster ride i still consider myself an ape on the sidelines in this whole fiasco its been such a crazy last couple of months and i honestly havent had this much internet excitement in my life this is the very first and only stock that ive ever purchased and although i dont know shit about stocks i understand the concept but thats it this is something ill never forget im happy for everyone whos lives have changed for the better and its heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity but im gonna be a negative nancy ape for a bit you guys saw it you guys are seeing it were all watching it live how manipulative media outlets are how quick they are at shooting their arrows how our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they questioned that bosnian whatever the fuck from robindahood they tried to grill our boy dfv more than any of them it really pissed me off watching that they tried throwing attention away from gme silver anyone lol they tried attacking this place they tried attacking day traders they tried attacking dfv they tried every single thing they could and failed i truly believe its because of the good intent in this sub that helped that and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck i mean i know the cliche of never trust the newsetc but to be watching it live is justi mean fuck if you cant see it by now youre obviously on the other side not only is no one going to be held accountable more than likely theyll just change up the rules to punish the little guys it really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor you honestly couldnt write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls a fucking store that buys and sells used video games a dude that seems like hed make keanu reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name roaring kitty on youtube and deepfuckingvalue on reddit exposed them but not because he wanted to fuck them over but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol its perfect tldrthe media sucks
451,65,2021-03-17 13:35:02,thank you citadel if nothing else i am thankful to have been a part of all this just to have been able to witness and experience the sheer extent of extreme dystopian manipulation and fuckery that people in power are capable of this will not stop with gme this will be something we have to live with and fight for the rest of our lives i am thankful to have this opportunity to better learn how to recognize it over something as trivial as a stock citadel must be livid that peasants who have never traded a stock in their lives have already cost them $6 billion and are now immune to their attempts to persuade them into selling this experience will be a valuable tool for everyone who has been a part of this for the rest of their lives edit i believe the endgame fud will be an attempt to convince diamond hands that other apes wont hold past 1k 10k 1m etc
232,63,2021-03-17 12:57:49,open gme calls puts 0319 i just had a look at the option chains of gme 0319 status from 03172021 at 300$ there will be 11619 puts itm and 77465 calls itm at 200$ there are 29845 puts itm and 54045 calls itm at 150$ there will be 50619 puts itm and 43915 calls itm this data ca be found on the nasdaq option chain website so feel free to check for yourself x200b update from 03182021 at 300$ there will be 11701 puts itm and 85833 calls itm at 200$ there are 28070 puts itm and 51891 calls itm at 150$ there will be 46496 puts itm and 43541 calls itm this data ca be found on the nasdaq option chain website so feel free to check for yourself x200b so what does this mean for friday 0319 every gme stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies day and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on every gme stock price above 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters so i guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$ every gme stock price below 150 $ on 0319 will end in well so many puts then in the money this will end really bad for the stock price and shorters will make a lot of money to reload their shorting ammo x200b tldr gme above 300 $ on friday start to valhalla from friday on gme above 170$ on friday calls will still win gme will rise more anything below 150$ on friday here we go again 40$ gme so its very important this week that we and the long wales are able to keep the stock price 170$ x200b edit regarding covered calls vs naked calls the huge amounts of new 800c calls last week didnt help us because it was way out of the money for the marketmakers so they didnt see a reason to cover those calls stock price was 260 usd last week and 800$ was 3x the stock price when a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the mm that they dont cover their calls then why should they cover those 200$ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago at 40$ stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then and therefore way out of the money so i really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this friday so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercisedif theres some pro here who can clarify the mms covering process id be grateful
89,8,2021-03-17 12:16:53,to all hedgies and apes hi hedgies first and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips i am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer have you not learned honestly even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go you are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape think about it all you had to do was buy to cover seriously it wasnt difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right the little guys have been losing all their life while youre used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair stock market and that anyone can become rich im not trying to make you mad i just think you are at this point fighting a losing battle i do however sympathize with you only a little bit you just havent seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money in a fair market thats how it should have been in the first place the thing is you should have covered when we said gme to $1000 honestly this could have been the best decision of you life you were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation you were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better it that couldnt make you feel better about losing money then nothing will but seriously instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that i havent seen in years you really dont know how millennials yet think do you hint we dont give a shit about anything no matter how long it takes you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point i dont think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer next my fellow retards hdol nothing more left to say keep buying dips and wait just wait it will happen eventually no time limit needed on how long it takes we hold forever remember if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind we are not we are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $42069 and beyond my blind senses are tingling this is going to be one epic year i cant wait to go to gamestop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them because gme is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us to the moon and beyond wherever we go gamestop will be there also heres a picture for those that cant read which is soooo many of you x200b not a financial advice
52,119,2021-03-17 11:50:46,give it to me straight when gme moons it could potentially crash the market right is the safe play to move my other investments into bondsliquid to be safe yeah yeah i know you guys are going to say i should move my other stuff to gme but im already in for $125k and i dont have enough faith in the sec to guarantee i dont get completely screwed when this blows up so im thinking i should take the rest of my money out of vtsax and put it into bondsmmliquid for a week or two until this shakes out if the shorts are forced to liquidate whether on their own or via dtcc changes its going to have a major impact on other stocks if it moons like we think into the next galaxy it could crash the market whats the safe play
97,94,2021-03-17 10:23:24,can the mms and hfs keep artificially increasing gme float synthetic shares to keep kicking the shortsqueeze down the road not a financial or legal advisor honest question im a pretty sophisticated ape unless i am missing something the only way for 10646 of float to be held by institutions and 2188 of the float to be held by insiders data courtesy of tradeideas is if some of the shares held long are synthetic shares how is that even possible rhetorical question my understanding is synthetic shares are used to ensure liquidity in the options market but the ious are supposed to be settled with actual shares if an option is exercised rather than spend hours studying the regs i will just assume either 1 the rules do not impose a sufficient amount of auditreconciliation requirements or 2 rules are being broken either way it seems the mms and hfs have been able to create synthetic shares which are then sold and purchased long in the market apart from confirming how rigged and fucked up the system is cant they just keep this game up forever in other words cant they just purchase a bunch of inthemoney call options and exercise them to buy back the shares and return them to the lender there is a theory that is what the hedgies tried to do last week in their short ladder attack and that it was actually the hedgies that had purchased the $300 and $325 call options and that it was the long whales who prevented the price from being $300 last friday so the hedgies could not exercise their options as they are running out of shares held long btw i am bullish on gme and have a large position so certainly not to rain on anyones parade edit 1 my karma is too low to respond to comments i get the data out there is different on what the held by institutions actually is but the question remains that the amount of shares held long the float edit 2 i am a big time technical trader the stock certainly is not behaving normally it is constantly being manipulated hence the dive on extremely low volume premarket this morning which induced a minor panic sell the fact that so much manipulation is going on of the stock price tells me this story is far from over edit 3 i understand how short selling works i understand that brokers irresponsibly lend out the same share multiple times but before we even get to what the true short float is we have institutionalinsiderretail who hold 100 of the float that alone should cause the infinity squeeze even if the short float were only 20 but they keep finding shares to shortif they are not real shares what are they and if the same share is lent to shorts multiple times the same share is owned long by multiple people yet the mms still sold thousands of call options last week hundreds of which were in the money how can options even be sold if there are no shares available
2216,436,2021-03-17 09:17:32,i really dont feel like saying this but please use a better brokerage please for the love of god so help me if i see one more post with a 100000$ account going long on gme in robin hood im going to strap a propane tank to myself and become a grill for two seconds before i fucking explode next time momma wants some grilled dogs please for the ever loving fuck if you use robinhood sign up on fidelity it took me literally 15 minutes today 15 minutes and i get to sleep soundly knowing none of my shit gets shorted to oblivion i will do you one better when you move to fidelity you can literally fund it directly from robinhood just click on manage account and find transfer brokerage then plugin your robinhood account number and baam now robinhood literally cant fucking short your game stock shares they have to send those motherfuckers directly to fidelity and are now out of extra powder somebody with more wrinkles has probably done a better job of explaining this maybe somebody could go the extra 8th mile and create a massive post with it all and have the mods pin it gme 800c apr 4th
451,195,2021-03-17 09:02:15,rkt catalyst coming at the right time before the triple witching 319 hello friends in the past few weeks i was have been trying to get positioned into rkt i have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term in the short term i see a lot of upside potential with 100 return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this friday 319 which is very possible with all the indicators i will cover in this post short interest is up todays volume was a bit lower than the daily average 15m volume the stock is starting to be put on shortselling restricted lists which means shorts are overrisked and brokerages know this rkt has a relatively small float with high short interest it wont take a lot to light the match the options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period were at $25 its not a lot to ask for shorts still in the game as of march 13th 208m shares are still short representing $537000000 6 fee during the minisqueeze only about 13 of shorts left and many reshorted data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to opps under report check out the strike of $30 with 48889 contracts on a float of only 100000000 a little bigger than gme that represents 4888900 shares just there usually mms will buy 50 or so as it approaches itm so the float is about 100 million shares making it 225 billion however the company is 50 billion in other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike so above $65 likely also remember we have the dtcc new rule coming soon we dont know the date yet but thats making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with they really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price this week dtcc rule housing data comes out march 17th this will show what we all already know housing market is on fire 1 housing prices are rising this motivates new construction home renovations and people to sell at a profit 2 employment is strengthening 3 economy is rebounding 4 work from home people want more space are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs 5 low rates continue open call options look at the open call options of rkt for friday march 19th 49856 contracts at $2889 we are currently at $2644 if we hit that strike by friday we could have a huge gamma squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well at the same day rkt ceo says their share price at $43 is ok but they are still not being fairly valued to peers stimulus triple witching stimulus checks hit the banks march 17th this is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks imo triple witching triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options stock index futures and stock index option contracts all on the same day triple witching happens four times a year on the third friday of march june september and december triple witching days particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bellcalled the triple witching hourcan result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close roll out or offset their expiring positions if you did not know about this hang on to your seats these hedge funds are so good at doubling down x200b rkt trending on rwallstreetbets long term housing market on the move and mortgage companies are going to be on fire the housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links gl lol but it shows we are mooning and so is the housing market what does this mean for rocket well it indicates that rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term the current price is such a fire sale it isnt even comparable to what we will see in 510 years from now inflation is about to take place and we may see 510 increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this this is bullish for rocket and thats why i will be holding rocket long term tldr rkt is going to gamma squeeze if we break $2900 and 319 triple witching will push the price past previous highs rkt is a great short term and long term play rkt catalysts stimulus open calls housing data march 17th short interest 35 and triple witching 319 disclaimer 1000 shares $2606 this is not financial advise either just free information for you to stay informed on the hottest stock soon to be 
294,43,2021-03-17 08:40:05,citadel regulations dd reposting as god damnit apes i spent hours going through this and i dont think enough have seen it welcome back to another episode of my legal series dd where brokers manipulate the market and the fines dont matter i hear some say well citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt gave no admission and were censured which is a fancy wrist slap when they breached the rules so they would never do it again right wrong basically citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic oh no i got caught fee for each breach and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business my aim is to help apes in that bu knowing their history of breaches this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent dd i hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the moass approaches these disclosures have been brought up before but those posts ive seen did not go into too much detail and whilst i appreciate many other brokers have disclosures citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in gme so lets dig in buckle up apes this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows as always not financial advice always do your own dd before making any financial decisions citadel has a total of 59 disclosures in order to understand whether this is a lot i compared them to our friends at blackrock who have only 1 there are big boys with more than citadel mind blackrocks total fines $2955 for an omission of fact likely a clerical error citadels $33425568 for a whole host of things and yes i added them all up to arrive at this number whilst i know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions and it is this is the fault of the law on maximum fines not necessarily the agencies themselves its better to look at the staggering relative difference between the 2 lets see my highlight reel of the top 10 1 case 317772 01132017 $22668268 sanction disgorgementrestitution monetary fine a cease and desistinjuction summary from late 2007 through january 2010 despite citadel saying they provide best execution for their clients two of their algorithms did not scalping some $52mm from their client brokers they paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 06 of their trades didnt in this period these algorithms have allegedly been discontinued 2 case sec file no 318915 12102018 $3500000 monetary fine cease and desistinjunction summary from november 2012 august 2016 citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the sec which undermines the secs potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers 3 case 2010023518001 10192016 $1000000 sanction censure monetary fine summary citadel had an algo strategy which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open impacting the proper pricing of securities in addition this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications their supervision was criticized 4 case 2016051085001 10272020 $180000 sanction censure monetary fine summary between september 2015 and july 2016 citadel had a selfdescribed system issue which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules once again supervisory issues 5 case star no 20180580176 file no usri8731 02282020 $10000 sanction censure monetary fine summary citadel security failed to close out fails to deliver 6 case 20190500001 02072020 $15000 sanction censure monetary fine summary citadel improperly cancelled 231 marketonclose orders relating to a single basket of securities and ive heard this before once again failed to properly supervise their systems 7 case 20180590083 01232020 $15000 sanction censure monetary fine summary citadel allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event and you guessed it once again lacked proper supervisory procedures im getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say oh x didnt know theyre not trained as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company 8 case 2016071306 09292017 $80000 sanction censure monetary fine summary through july 2014 and september 2016 citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and once a fucking gain failed to implement proper supervisory procedures this best bid shit is not the first of its kind and its where citadel makes their $$$ 9 case 2008015772801 09032015 $200000 sanction censure monetary fine summary from february 2006 august 2009 citadel delayed execution for orders over 10000 shares on penny stocks from february 2006 february 2009 citadel deleted its email communications suspect as fuuuuuck and once again their supervisory procedures were deficient 10 case 2010022334502 06162014 $800000 sanction censure monetary fine summary on 24 occasions through march 18 2010 to february 28 2014 citadel manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders in april 2010 used an outdated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position in august 2011 updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop on december 13 2012 used inaccurate market data to capitalise on limit orders and finally sent millions of orders to the exchanges without execution and removed a limit imposed on citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second fuck me so what does this tell us from 1 we know citadel looks out for itself only itll fuck over their clients exchange and retail alike to profit from 2 we know citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly sld and clearing fund anyone from 3 we know citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves from 4 we know citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions from 5 we know citadel will fail to settle failures to deliver from 6 we know citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders from 7 we know citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves from 8 we know citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for i imagine brokers they pay for order flow for cough robinhood cough from 9 we know citadel will mess with orders and then likely delete evidence implicating them from 10 jesus christ we know citadel doesnt give a fuck about market manipulation tldr citadel doesnt give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself and it will do everything it can to prevent the moass as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves know thy enemy apes expect fuckery from here on out

220,38,2021-03-17 23:40:03,3172021 gme open interest report at yesterdays close of 20814 im an idiot this is just data that may be useless this isnt financial or legal advice for entertainment purposes only see disclaimer at the end of post tldr buy gme this week for the pop next week as of yesterdays closing price of 20814 and current open interest 3245 million shares are inthemoney for options expiring tomorrow that is 6 of the entire inventory of gme shares out there the pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next wednesday the higher gme closes on friday the more it will hurt summary 1 total exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to $25 billion from $26 billion the day beforea 4 decrease the share price went down by almost 6 so this is a slight bullish sign indicating that investors put more money in itm call options betting that the price will go up see figure 1 and table 1 2 exposure for just the the options expiring friday is $889 million down from $924 milliona 4 decrease this is another slight bullish signalthey think its going up by friday see table 1 3 the number of shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to 116 million 21 of total float from 121 million 22 of float see figure 2 and table 1 4 the number of shares or equivalents needed to cover fridays short option positionsaloneis relatively unchanged at 3245 million 6 of total float down from 3394 million 6 of float see table 1 5 the minimum exposure point for this fridays options decreased to 150 see table 2 this is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150 this a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even x200b x200b limitationsweaknessesbackground this is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question if a hypothetical single actormarket maker was on the short side of all open options in gme which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself what would that single actors exposure be in terms of dollars how many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions note that this does not represent this market makers loss to sell an option this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position also it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasingselling shares on the open market to cover short positions finally a major weakness of this curiosity is that by its nature it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything in reality we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders

73,91,2021-03-19 05:15:04,what is going to happen to gme over the next few days i am new to technical analysis but after some research i found some common patterns channels there are two types of channels ascending rising or and descending it is characterized by two parallel lines from the highs and lows formed over the course of several days once a channel is formed a breakout either up or down the channel will signal a bullish or a bearish trend if the break is above the channel then it is bullish which means you should probably buy in if the break is below the channel then it is bearish which means you should probably sell or short we see that gme right now is in a descending channel and it can break either up or down the breakout can happen tomorrow or in several days we dont know but once the price breaks the channel we know if it will go up or down no technical analysis is 100 accurate but it increases the probability this is not financial advice source chart pattern 
2371,241,2021-03-19 05:07:32,why i think $gme is still bullish and going to moon fellow apes i know many of you me included have been through some tough days and hours many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse sold your $gme stocks with huge losses i want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost nothing is lost until you sell in fact of course i have no idea what im talking about im really no one to trust in financial advice so be aware but still i am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining trends in stocks need corrections thats basic dowtheory and how much do they correct in general a 05 fibretracement correction is very usual in almost all trends they even sometimes correct a fibretracement below so when youre looking at my chart now very fancy colors buy you will see that were pretty exact around that retracement now furthermore price tried to go under ema50 but directly went up again to the exact position of ema50 where are we now correct almost at ema50 but not below this is a hell of a support and were not letting it fall below my fellow apes furthermore ema100 and ema200 are still showing upward movement which is also good last but not least macd aims for its zeroline and might turn positive you ask when hm if you look at the macd trend it might be soon as you can see from my perspective everything is still fine for disclosure im stuck in the upper 300s in gme and i wont sell before we reach at least four digits tldr trend is still fine ema50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon i like the stock and you should like it too x200b my technical analysis on $gme edit some of you have pointed out we shouldnt put dates on our analysis and i must say i agree although i see a very good chance of upward movement soon we shouldnt link this to today or monday this might be a long time play just see when dfv started posting about his yolos this wasnt for the short term
0,40,2021-03-19 03:11:38,healthy discussion about potential risk of gamestop please support this thread hi mods and apes i want to create a thread where we can have a healthy discussion of the potential risk of gme wallstreetbets is turning itself as gmebet nothing else gme is not that relevant anymore in my opinion anything raising doubts or discussing potential downside will be downvote to dead whenever i reply to a comment will get the downvote attack as well or fill with trash comments like apes cant read etc its toxic and unhealthy the posts that i put up got taken down in 5 seconds due to not enough popularity how is that manipulation or we need better training for the new mods im betting against gme with leap options as i disclosed before so at this level i think gme is dangerous and have more downside than upside looking at every single metric here is what im thinking x200b next week post earning gme is likely to announce a huge secondary offering to pay down debt and raise capital this makes perfect sense given the amount of buyback they did in the past this is a oncealifetime opportunity for gme which is great there is no easy way to turn this company around i dont say this easily but ea has origin activision has battle net ubisoft has its own and steam how many of you are buying games majority from retail these days im talking about the mainstream looking at those companies earning there is no sign this will be changing anytime soon i dont know the short squeeze gamma squeeze still holds you can claim all data are fake then im not sure why people are still living or trading in this country even the stock price is fake it doesnt matter if it has a short squeeze or not the big boys can just change the price like a video game if you are on fake news and fake data camp please move on many big tech and great companies are getting hammered either people are selling to meet their margin requirement or reserving cash to buy the dip later gme is not comparable to many of the good deals out there sec may be stepping in at any time for some actions good or bad will impact the stock price its clear to me that there were many hedge funds were involved in driving up the stock price pd there are still a ton of bag holders at the 300 and 400 levels if you disagree so someone will definitely get caught for some illegal behavior at some point there are 2 different kinds of hedge funds just so you know the short that got burned and the speculating ones that gain a ton off retail apes tldr were here at wsb is to try to make money and beat the market so even gme was good at one point is no longer good at this level if you disagree but please be civil and nice bring up your points rather than trashing talks and attacks
5,24,2021-03-19 02:36:10,how to gain capital to invest to btfd im a cpa and this is not financial advice i saw someone ask if they should continue to float their credit card balance to invest more into gme so i created this post to show other options to gain cash please keep in mind that taking out loans to invest is risky and requires personal risk assessment these options will give you lower risk than a credit card this is also what high net worth people do to take advantage of low interest rates and leverage assets with yields rising and the dip growing now is a perfect time to gain some capital there are 3 routes that you can do besides floating your credit card 1 taking out a personal loan 815 interest 2 collateral loans 48 interest example what i did would be to put your car or another asset you own up as collateral 3 home equity loans line of credit all of these outlets will provide you with much lower interest to get cash now while also improving your credit score as you pay them off the total process will take a few hours and youll get the cash the same day banks will be happy for your business i personally used my car as collateral and received $7000 at 35 the total cost of the loan will be less than $200 which ive already made back and as always btfd

8,11,2021-03-19 00:52:00,luminar technologies 50 shorted despite great growth potential hey everyone i found out about wall street bets via the gme situation and i think i bought it at the most expensive price its ever been lol i understand that the reason the stock shot up in value was because of the short squeeze my question is can the same thing happen to the luminar technologies stock according to market watch it was 50 shorted this morning but this number is increasing 53 at the moment however the business which creates sensors for autonomous cars has great growth prospects the ceo austin russell who dropped out of stanford following a $100k grant from peter thiel seems driven by his passion for science this passion has translated into him developing high quality lidar sensors at a fraction of the cost of his competitors the shorting seems speculative considering the company is increasing its business and currently has partnerships with volvo subsidiaries and the chinese automobile company saic is now expected to start using lidar sensors in 2022 im going to hold this stock to the moon ive bought 1000 shares so far as the business is not going anywhere but i wanted to get people opinions if wall street try any of the tactics they did with gme on this stock ill be very happy as it means i can buy more at a great price unlike with the gme this stock is the future
71,92,2021-03-19 00:49:54, is jim cramer as good of a guy as wsb thinks he is gme to the moon  so ive always loved jim cramer but im scared with cancel culture coming around he might end up getting cancelled i would hate for that to happen if theres anything out there he can get cancelled for i hope it doesnt get in the hands of social media because then we cant save him we love jim cramer we are just looking out for him regardless of that point i want you guys to know i truly love this community and i owe my life to it ive had a lot of depression in the last year and this is the only place i feel like home sometimes yeah since ive joined wsb ive lost 40k but its the most fun money ive ever lost im literally happy i lost it i dont get it apes will always be together strong nothing can get between us especially those grimy hedge fund fucks we own the market now lets show them what were made of i believe in each and every one of you tldr gme 41 800c dont be fooled
73,9,2021-03-18 23:54:22,3182021 gme open interest report at yesterdays close of 20981 im an idiot this is just data that may be useless this isnt financial or legal advice for entertainment purposes only see disclaimer at the end of post draw your own conclusions tldr im still buying gme but these guys may get another month option positions appear to be rolling over to april 16 2021 but at some point these shares are going to have come back home look at the data and draw your own conclusions im not a financial advisor but im a legit autist who found out i can export a lot of shit out of thinkorswim had excel for work and made nice curves id like smarter apes to help me interpret the data since im not entirely sure my analysis is correct so please leave your thoughts in the comments i encourage criticism but read the disclaimer at the end of the post for stuff which i will repeat as a comment and respond to that summary 1 total exposure to short positions on options stayed relatively constant at $25 billion as compared to yesterday this is consistent with price action which was also relatively flat see figure 1 and table 1 2 exposure for just the the options expiring friday is $880 million down from $889 milliona 1 decrease see table 1 3 the number of shares or equivalents needed to cover all short positions on itm options decreased by about 400000 shares to 114 million shares 21 of total float see figure 2 and table 1 4 this was almost entirely due to a decrease in the number of shares to cover fridays itm positions which is down about 350000 and is now 2893 million shares 534 of total float it appears at first glance that several options were rolled over to otm positions in later months there is no telling how long this can go on which is a common criticism from yesterday 5 the minimum exposure point for this fridays options is steady at 150 see table 2 bottom of blue curve on figure 1 and where curve crosses 0 on figure 2 for most stocks having a price that is significantly above this price is usually a bearish sign because it means there are a lot of incentives from people with a lot of money on the line to move the price of gme to that point it also tends to be the point where smart people who buy options have indicated they think the price is going to land that said im not sure how strong incentives are for that to happenit would only decrease exposure from $880 million to $800 million it is still a lot of money x200b limitationsweaknessesbackground this whole exercise was the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question if a hypothetical single actormarket maker was on the short side of all open options in gme which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself what would that single actors exposure be in terms of dollars how many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions note that this does not represent this market makers loss to sell an option this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position also it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasingselling shares on the open market to cover short positions finally i acknowledge that this is not realistic market makers and the like are not a monolith and they are constantly supposed to be hedging all of the time this is a major weakness of this curiosity because it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything in reality we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders the reason i didnt keep this to myself though is that i need smarter folks to explain to me why there is such a huge deviation between the minimum exposure point table 2 for options expiring on friday and the share price for most stocks there is not a deviation and if there is it isnt this big and it doesnt last for multiple days on end
64,27,2021-03-18 22:58:39,psa dont try to be clever like i did and try to transfer a portion of your position in a security out of robinhood theyll block you out of trading that security entirely until it completes so looks like im getting forced to hold gme past earnings i did a partial transfer of 13 of my shares in gme to etrade and now im locked out of making any trade in gme robinhood didnt notify me of this restriction or prompt me to accept the transfer i just woke up this morning with my limit orders all canceled and no ability to trade position 165 gme shares around 140 average only 25 shares currently tradable on a different brokerage
0,355,2021-03-18 16:47:02,gme disinfo exposed 1 why the $gme moass post that hit the front page is pure bullshit theres a lot of misinformation going around wsb right now and the common knowledge is that hedge funds shorting gme are the source of it unfortunately common knowledge isnt always correct knowledge the reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on wsb right now is very progme and the new crowd here which consists mostly of greenhorn traders who dont really understand how the market functions is lapping it up the people 600 upvotes participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand or even just make terms up source 185k upvotes there are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding gme i wrote about it a bit here unfortunately that post was deleted by automod when i edited a youtube link into the text and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post regardless ive noticed many of the same progme talking points being recycled often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about gme you can love the stock thats fine but if you really love the stock its important to know how youre being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page in this thread ill be addressing this post 211k upvotes specifically and ill also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims claim 1 gme is inverselycorrelated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls there does seem to be some correlation between gme and the broader market but this doesnt imply causation or shorts getting squeezed its not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off exhibit a exhibit b notice how riots peak in 2018 coincides with spys trough thats correlation but not causation why does this happen i cant say for sure but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility so when funds pull out of the broader market they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a store of wealth until the selloff is finished at which point they cash out and reenter the market just speculating though what i can prove however is that the claim that the broader market and gme are inversely correlated is complete bullshit and it takes only the barest most basic amount of research here ive overlayed the sp 500 with gme if there were any correlation you would see gme go down roughly whenever spy went up and viceversa not good enough think gme ought to be valued as a tech company nasdaq similary shows no correlation yes i know the overlays arent perfect but im working on an ipad here cut me some slack regardless you can see there is no correlation proving that this part of bows_n_hoes post is bullshit for the record i do think there was an inverse correlation between gme and the broader market back in february in my opinion there genuinely was a threat of system collapse the ibkr chairman himself admitted that request a link to the vid in comments and ill provide i cant post it in op or my post will get whacked in this case hedge funds likely did have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts this led to the broader market falling while gme squoze as demonstrated this correlation no longer exists note this claim is about inverse correlation is the same as another unfounded claim 44k upvotes that hit the front page of wsb and which one of wsbs mods similarly dismantled claim 2 the illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140 ownership the post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market while this is theoretically possible but illegal this is pure speculation so how then might you ask can a stock display over 100 ownership when stocks are shorted they are borrowed from someone who owns the stock and then sold now the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another all of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock so imagine it this way i lend my dildo to my friend and then he lends that dildo to his friend i would report owning that dildo my friend would report owning that dildo albeit temporarily and his friend would report owning that dildo so you see how one single dildo can become three investopedia even has an article about this the same thing is happening to gme and any claims that higher than 100 institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation of which no one has yet provided proof claim 3 no seriously these synthetic shares are real and are being sold back and forth on the market place do you know what you get when you google synthetic shares a bunch of indian biomed companies with synthetic in their company name do you know what happens when you control for these indian biomed companies you get results that are basically nothing if synthetic shares were a real phenomenon you wouldnt have to go digging through this many foreign smallcap biomed companies to find any information about it and before anyone chimes in snthetic call options and put options are real but those are very different from what op is claiming claim 4 hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by gmes rise people who make this claim often resort to proving it by using complex calculations depend on incomplete data make suppositions discard any data that disproves their claims source 600 upvotes however we dont need to do any logical loopdeloops to prove that gme doesnt have an exceptionally high level of short interest in fact all we have to do is go to an old fan favorite of wsb to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear concise argument here we have a few important metrics short interest 16 the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float while 16 is atypically high its nowhere near the purported 100350 some suspicious people with onemonth old accounts are shilling borrow rate 06 particularly low borrow rates that is the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis go up a lot the more a stock is shorted for reference rkt was at 20 a few weeks ago borrow availability 300000 shares the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as no shares available for shorting for a long time days even since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short so there you have it three very simple easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe to believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wideranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims ethics and stakes involving thousands of people and all to cover up the true short rate of just one stock occams razor yall conclusion now you have to ask yourself do you like the stock or do you like the hype because if its the former then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it if its the latter then have fun on this wild ride but dont lie or support lying to your fellow wsbers its immoral and its not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is tldr buying more
351,37,2021-03-18 13:47:24,the gme failtodeliver loophole stock lending and how you can stop it todays congressional hearing touched on the key mechanism that enables abusive levels of failtodelivers in stocks like gme stock lending this is particularly relevant because unlike future aspirations for t0 settlement you can actually do something about this today if you dont want to help people who are exploiting sharelending loopholes to do naked shorting then you can optout this way your broker wont lend your shares behind your back just a few highlights from todays hearing 15000 timecode which further confirm what has been explained in other wsb posts according to a report from bloomberg government which analyzed the sec data $359 million of gme shares failed to deliver or be covered suggesting that many of the shares had been borrowed more than once the new insight for me was in the dennis kellehers reply to this statement the current regulations only require brokerdealers to have a reasonable ground to believe the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the delivery date the current regulation is a joke in other words this kind of language would not be enforceable by the sec even if it had the will to do so he continues the publicly available information certainly indicates that there s a very high likelihood of abusive shortselling by somebody somebody lends a security to somebody who lends it to somebody else who lends it to somebody else its almost a house of cards and to protect yourself against that falling house of cards if only there were a stock with a beta of 2 the irony is that here is a sound rational basis to buy gme as a hedge against a falling market which only increases the probability of that outcome

234,76,2021-03-18 07:51:03,rkt why holding through boring days is key to success rkt has been very boring lately jumps get sold off immediately today the price was pinned at 245 for basically the whole day the 2nd half of the day you can see increased volume but price action diminshed from this and the past few days closing at exactly $25 a couple days closing at $245 today sound familiar we know that rkt is being manipulated the boringness is intentional to get you to lose interest and seek better opportunities elsewhere weve seen this previous in gme when it was flat at $5060 for quite a while before shorts covered again in the short term and without major news stock trading is a zerosum game every dollar the hf make comes from your realized losses the goal is to convince you that you should take a loss here and fomo somewhere else this is where you need to have some conviction you might lose out on opportunity cost well the shorts also lose out on opportunity cost while some stocks will have long term shorts like gme when it seemed like it was going to bankruptcy that is because there is an end game for shorts there when the company reaches eventual bankruptcy is rkt going to bankrupt any time soon no they are growing fast and taking more market shares than competitors the shorts in rkt are shortterm shorts especially the ones who shorted at $40 they were making a risky play there rkt had the potential to squeeze higher this means that they will look to take profits sooner rather than later and look for opportunities elsewhere remember pigs get slaughtered have some conviction hold through the calm and you will be rewarded with the storm hopefully a tornado to lift up your portfolio to the moon ps this doesnt apply to all stocks most meme stocks will slowly bleed for many months or years after a spike and you will be left bag holding thats true opportunity cost you need to examine the underlying company and think about the situation in your opponents shorts shoes
144,55,2021-03-20 08:45:31,$gme conservative outlook technical analysis macd wr dmi based i have been seeing gme squeeze by x date a lot in this sub and i think its fun to theorize when it will happen however the truth is we dont know when it will happen and its almost impossible to try to guess what we can do however is predict the next bearish or bullish cycles within gme and we can position ourselves accordingly to trade well for example holders can have an idea of how long they need to hold so you dont get spooked into selling too early and buyers can enter in at educated price points gme is currently in the very last days of its bullish macd sentiment in the chart below we can see that on 225 macd flipped to positive triggering the start of a bull run as of 319 the macd histogram bar is very low and with wr and di trending down it looks like on monday macd will flip to negative confirming a bear run 225 319 now the question is how long will bearish sentiment last for for reference lets look at the last two times the macd histogram was negative x200b 127226 in this example 24224 we can see that bearish sentiment lasted about 14 trading days we should note however that this is right after huge volume and sudden spike in price now another example x200b 128113 looking back from 1210112 we can see that gme was following a 6 to 8 day bearish to bullish trend important to note is that these trends did not spike the price too much and volume was relatively low now looking ahead to 322 and onward i can safely predict that there should be a bearish trend this doesnt necessarily mean prices will dramatically plummet but institutions know that trying to raise prices against negative macd momentum isnt favorable also i can also say that if a bearish trend starts it should last something like 614 days our most recent bullish trend had decent volume and there was also a pretty dramatic price change and so i think the real number will in the middle of those two extremes now i know that is a very large window of time but it really does depend on what happens during the next two weeks to determine if the macd histogram will overturn events like the earnings report on 323 and if rc announces a ceo position could help overturn sentiment im sorry if this doesnt feed your confirmation bias or if you think im trying to spread fud i just wanted to share so we can make educated trades and stay in the game longer so we can get this thing to squeeze obligatory emojis edit changed trigger to confirm as the comments pointed out 312 wouldve been the start to bearish sentiment
337,119,2021-03-20 07:08:18,setting the record straight on borrow availability in gme there has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in gme shares the most common one is that iborrowdesk ibkr is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace this is false iborrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from fido schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time ironically this means the more their clients buy gme on margin the more borrow availability there will be the real borrow market availability in its most basic form the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities hate to break it to yall but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock when an institution such as pension fund mutual fund insurance company buys gme or any other stock for that matter those shares are held at their custodian a custody bank such as jpm citi state street bony aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program most are those shares are lent to broker dealers the large broker dealers all have prime brokerage groups that custody assets for hedge funds one of the main functions of a prime broker is to lend stock to hedge funds to short bds act as the middle man between the custody bank and the hedge fund how does a pb know where to borrow gme you ask easy the custody banks broadcast all of their stocks available for lending to broker dealers the pbs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the custody banks and broadcast this information to hedge funds included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the pb from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin so each day every pb in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to hfs to short heres the rub this information is not available to the general public securities lending or stock loan is a purposely opaque market this allows the pbs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost on that topic of cost given that the general public does not have the same access to this information the cost to borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability case in point when gme first squeezed in late january there was zero borrow available to short as such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200 think about that that high cost is untenable and impossible for a hf to stay short for very long obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up every bdpbs ability to borrow stock is different think of hard to borrow securities like gme as an allocation of shares in ipo process not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an ipo the same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or special security like gme the custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers bdpbs that pay them the most revenue throughout the year it stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest pbs that have enormous borrow demand thus bony will lend gme to a gs or jpm before lending it to ibkr or fido both with very small pb groups you with me so far so lets look at the loan side of that transaction bony lends gme to gs now gs will lend that scarce resource of gme borrow to hf clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year thus gs is more likely to lend gme in this scenario to a citadeli know i know bridgewater or de shaw vs a small 50mmaum hedge fund control and aggregation of borrow market availability although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants custody banks bdpbs the largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability they submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants only so a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost because the bdpbs custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder pension plan mutual fund and hedge funds this is a main reason why large hfs have multiple pbs because everyones stock borrow capability is different they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible the only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large pbs and ask for the info obviously this is not going to happen i happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are millions of shares of gme to borrow right now and for the past month given that the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the cost to borrow which is more readily available through your bd even if they arent showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow generally speaking any cost to borrow below 10 implies there is borrow available at 5 it is virtually a liquid or gc general collateral borrow a further reference point would be rkt which squeezed several weeks ago there was very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30 borrow cost at the time dont even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short i generally do not recommend retail investors going short it is a sure fire way to go broke that said even though your broker may show you zero borrow to go short i guarantee they are giving availability to their hf clients hope that helps it does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency i just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iborrow or their bd is showing no borrow in the case of gme this has been the case all day today rest assured there are millions of gme shares available to short
445,50,2021-03-20 06:14:05,not here to tell you gme is hitting 1k next week however one fundamental indicator shows that it could be a strong investment no triangles included im learning about risk analysis for one of my classes so i figured why not practice sharpe analysis with gme sharpe ratio per investopedia the sharpe ratio is used to help investors retards understand the return of an investment a 401k yolo compared to its risk the ratio is the average return earned in excess of the riskfree rate per unit of volatility or total risk conceptually what this provides is a measurement of the portfolios outperformance per unit of the portfolios volatility x200b imgur link check my math here please correct me if i did this wrong or ill fail my class but this shows that ytd the portfolios 100 gme diversification performance has outperformed the volatility or risk associated with it no idea where its going next week but gme having a 5 sharpe ratio a professional risk measurement formula is off the charts for what is considered good enjoy your weekend and see yall on monday

1880,328,2021-03-21 10:48:14,apes i think i nailed it tldr madoff cut his teeth with fraud with pfof before moving to feeding off the whales in the mean time wall street adopted his fraud methods with pfof to feed off of retail it really is a big ponzi scheme ive been trying to dent my brain these last couple of months to get to understand whats been going on and why i believe in gme so much and then recently i feel a bomb had been dropped on me with the talk about payment for order flow and dark pool offmarket buys ive just started denting my brain by understanding how fails to deliver are hid in out of the money calls or puts or whatever and now i got to try and understand payment for order flow its like studying for the sat and then someone knocks on the door and tells you by the way you are taking the mcats tomorrow morning wtf so apparently pfof was started by madoff i think on the surface it looks legit but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys which explains why there is so much buying but it doesnt move the ticker at all while sells plummet it in seconds i guess the sec looks at this and says oh cool this was started by madoff and is now industry standard nothing to see here would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one is this why wall street and main street havent been the same street in a long time since 2008 earlier its starting to feel like wall street is one big ponzi scheme i know we all know that but when it happens for real its terrifying madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties how deep does this rabbit hole go how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole this is my favorite part of his wiki madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into bernard l madoff investment securities he served as its chairman until his arrest on december 11 200867 the firm was one of the top market maker businesses on wall street8 which bypassed specialist firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers fucking great then i went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this and holy fucking shit its almost all of them td ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed and vanguard who i was hoping to transfer to and now i got to sweat moving my shares from td something that makes me extremely nervous thinking that i might miss out on the rocket launch ive been so patiently waiting on any talk about moving from td is simply not on here lots of talk about robinhood and fidelity but any questions about td and i get down voted to oblivion so much fud so little time i remember when apes figured out shorts were being hid in etfs and how big of a bomb that was this pfof stuff feels bigger i dont think its getting the attention it deserves because we havent had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped short etfs hidden ftds etc good luck ever getting this talked about in congress they can hardly even address naked shorts they are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing calculus im so angry and frustrated and i dont know who to blame citadel sec madoff myself for being so ignorant on whats going on im so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help im just a homeless filmmaker arent real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this whats next i wake up and there is morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes have i become as crazy as all my friends and family think i am about gme have we become qanon what the fuck is going on this really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it isnt it this is madoff only this time madoff is all of wall street is every broker dealing with pfof a toxic dumping ground is it worth it to move from td how long will it truly take is every broker fucked are we all fucked all of these institutions are saying hey trust me with your money i learned everything i know from bernie madoff fuck shit fuck i want out and i dont know who to trust im angry scared exhilarated fuck it no matter what if i miss the rocket if it explodes if it launches me at 30 gs into the sun this has been a wild ride and well worth it i hope i know what im doing i hope that you do too but most of all i hope that this changes things for the better i hope all of you apes are rewarded and safe on your rocket ride im so confused and dont know who to trust the only thing i know is that i believe in the dd and i believe in you fellow apes any thoughts would be greatly appreciated peace and hodl tldr i think madoff cut his teeth with fraud with pfof before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales in the mean time wall street adopted his fraud methods with pfof feeding off of retail it really is a big ponzi scheme addendum you know the phrase it isnt a loss until you sell i think in citadels mind it also isnt a buy until you sell boom ponzi there is conflicting reports on vanguards

2410,465,2021-03-21 06:41:38,$gme potential pattern descending triangle to cup handle formation and possible bullish overturn breakdown with macd wr and dmi this time with pretty shapes hi all i made post yesterday about the bullishbearish trends that gme exhibited in the past 4 months i wanted to make a follow up post and share some pretty shapes i found in the charts with a few indicators to support the patterns thesis included first here is where we are with some lines drawn in x200b second according to investopedia there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern 1 trend to qualify as a continuation pattern a prior trend should exist ideally the trend should be a few months old and not too mature check 2 cup the cup should be u shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom a v shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify check 3 cup depth ideally the depth of the cup should retrace 13 or less of the previous advance however with volatile markets and overreactions the retracement could range from 13 to ½ kinda check we fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement and so we need to be a little weary 4 handle after the high forms on the right side of the cup there is a pullback that forms the handle sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward other times it is just a short pullback the handle represents the final consolidationpullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 13 of the cups advance but usually not more the smaller the retracement the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout kinda check again we fell from around 340 to 173 at one point however if only opening and closing prices ranges are factored it would be 275 to 201 this is only a 27 drop and a 33 drop would be 18315 5 duration the cup can extend from 1 to 6 months sometimes longer on weekly charts the handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 14 weeks almost there 6 volume there should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handles resistance maybe one day okay now lets look at just the handle x200b so we can clearly see downward trend lines with a support line hovering around 180ish here it is also backed with decreased macd momentum slight overselling wr trending down and signs of a dmi convergence evidence of bearish sentiment we will need to see if a downward triangle forms in the coming weeks if one forms then that further confirms bearish sentiment looking back at our handle rules we can see that a handle must be formed in 14 weeks and it looks like the handle formation began 6 trading days ago knowing that our bear trends for gme usually last 614 days the timing lines up perfectly for proper handle formation the only thing left is to wait out the handle and get a solid breakout with huge volume then gme go boom boom evidence of cup with handle pattern two high resistances with a low u shaped support in the middle formation of 14 weeks of price stagnation with a downward trendlines handle supported by wr dmi and macd potential reasons cup with handle might fail price fell too low out of expected range during u formation potentially price might fall too low during handle formation and most importantly there needs to be large volume to breakout of the handle also there may be a sub pattern forming as an inverse cup from 316319 i have not analyzed it much yet but it was pointed out to me by another redditor edit added one more potential reasons cup with handle might fail edit2 removed links edit3 my bad yall as pointed out in comments not descending triangle as that is a continuation pattern not a reversal pattern changing it to say downward trendlines instead cant change the title unfortunately lol what can i say im retarded obligatory emojis ty for the awards fucking love this sub
5522,629,2021-03-21 06:40:55,the great cuckening i have a feeling im not alone in this situation last week i finally decided fuck robinhood eat my ass vlad and started an account transfer to fidelity on wednesday fidelity has processed it but jabroni robinhood says it might take 57 days for it to process and clear lets say gme squeezes this week theoretically of course will i be stuck dick in hand unable to do anything of course i can always buy more at $500 on fidelity because i like the stock and know $500 is merely the bottom of stratosphere on the rocket ride to the moon but im definitely curious if my $147 avg cost shares will be untouchable thanks retards 1k upvotes on this autistic ass question just goes to show how much each individual here hates you vlad i hope you see this
10901,1134,2021-03-20 17:29:09,stop being robbed of call premium for the mirage of a gamma squeeze this advice was posted here countless times and yet here we go again if implied volatility is over 100200 theres very little money to be made with calls your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze well it wont fucking happen if youre paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging you would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls the cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with also that hefty call premium youre paying goes to those betting against gme stop giving them your power money to use against you it pisses me off to see normies and og retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions yes this is a casino but at least act like youre trying to win damnit edit heres a great comment that explains this in more detail 
8101,696,2021-03-23 06:58:36,gme poker cannibalism and why the apes are going to win this hand i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice listen up apes im about to give an explanation of what i think is going to happen even the smoothest of brains should be able to at least somewhat understand it now i know that most of you idiots descend to a near comatose state when you see deep technical anal or really anything with meaningful content so lets just talk about card games how do casinos make money on poker for each hand of poker played the casino takes a small percentage of the pot which is called the rake the casino provides the establishment and the dealers the players play and the casino takes its commission okay great but what the fuck does this have to do with gme were getting there hang on the edging is real but youll get your payoff so the casino takes its cut from each pot the more money in the pot the more money the casino makes great how do they maximize profits well they can bring in more players get players to play longer deal more hands per hour andor increase the average size of the pots im not going to answer how they accomplish most of these because it doesnt matter what matters is that the casinos are incentivized to do these things in order to increase their gains the point here is that you dont need to understand poker to understand how the casino makes money you just need to understand their business model lets focus on how to increase the average size of the pots there are tons of ways to do this but lets assume that instead of being in a giant casino youre at a local backalley gambling spot their operation isnt super sophisticated they just install a few of their cronys into each game each idiot has roughly the same set of goals bring people in loosen up the tables and create big pots as long as the gangsters dont put too much money on the table and lose it the house will profit theres one key point here that i havent mentioned yet no one can know that the game is crooked or else they wouldnt play and the house wouldnt make money right well thats not entirely true in fact its not at all true then why the fuck did i mention it well you tell me why the fuck would you play a rigged game even if the game is rigged and the players know that its a sham if its the best opportunity for people to expand their wealth they will still play not all of them but a lot of them in fact its even a good thing for the house when dumb money make money this brings them back and maybe even brings in some of their friends they just arent allowed to make too much too consistently the house wants you to play the house wants your friends to play the house wants everyone to play so how do you make sure that as many people as possible play did you fucking read the last paragraph its simple you make it the best way for anyone to make money you essentially force them to play dont get lost in the details it doesnt matter how this is accomplished they can lick you suck you fuck you beat you squeeze you whack the other competition off etc all that matters is that whatever game they run it is the best way for you to try to make it out of wage slavery so what happens when players make too much money i dont know what happens when theres a bug in your favorite games code what happens when the sheep start misbehaving a short sighted boss may blame the players or the bug or the sheep but the astute mobster knows that their fucking minions are to blame again the game is rigged and the minions have one fucking job follow the script and dont get too greedy any problem and i mean any problem is easy to ignore so long as the right wheels are greased and its not loud enough to annoy the whole fucking neighborhood reddit is an enormous echo chamber shit gets loud in here but as much as your tiny minds focus on gme most of the world does not give a flying fuck and even if this news gets big theyre not going to care theyre too tired and poor to focus on some group of retarded apes hitting the lottery so what the hell am i actually saying about gme the apes and their ancestors discovered a loophole in the financial system that was being abused but this time the minions went too far and the apes realized that they finally have the winning hand theres going to be a song and dance and threats and probably some suicides and even some epsteins but as long as the apes dont fold the apes win this round if the mobsters play this game right theyll fold this hand take their losses and as usual end up winning in the long run they just have to patch the system a bit and wait for people to forget some stuff this is ez mode do you know what happens in the mafia when a handful of its members threatens the entire fucking money making machine it doesnt matter if youre a friend of the family a bigly minion or even the fucking godfather you live by the sword you die by the sword when you have an infected limb you first try to treat it but if that doesnt work you cut that shit off these people are fucking cannibals and they dont mind eating their ownim sure that some of them even prefer it the shorters are going to get thrown into the meat grinder and the cannibals are going to feast tldr read the fucking post it took me way longer to write than it will take most of you to read it heres some since half of you autists need these to get off edit some of you are taking the poker analogy too literally its an oversimplification in several ways but the core argument still hodls apes will win some mobsters will get swallowed up
89,32,2021-03-23 05:17:51,treasury issuance calendar for the next week and why that matters if you have been in anything other than gme for the past month youve undoubtedly asked yourself what is a yield and why is it fucking up my tech holdings well heres a quick explanation and what to look out for this week what does yields have to do with it yields or most likely what its referencing the 10 year yield on us treasuries is the riskfree rate basically if you buy a 10 year treasury for $90 and hold it until maturity you get a 111 annual yield you absolutely cant go tits up with this unless you bought a north korean or turkish bonds in this case it becomes the price of money no one is willing to go lower than the 111 yield unless they hate money for mortgages loans and all sorts of businesses this is the theoretically cheapest anyone can borrow since no one has better credit or liquidity as the us government in the case of tech stocks some boomer back in the day decided to value stocks which provide dividends as a perpetual bond the formula for that is p couponrisk free rate tech stocks are especially sensitive to this since the coupon returning earnings to shareholders but you can argue buybacks should be this is basically 0 say if $100 $11 is the current boomer valuation if yields go up only 1 which isnt that out of place technically the stock price is supposed to be cut in half this is also why valuation methods like this dont work for gme or fast growing companies in any case this is just a boilerplate valuation method so what next the tantrum all started with the feb 2021 7year auction with a high yield of 1195 whats pesky about treasury auctions is that once the yieldprice is set for the the newest issue the on the run bond all previous bonds of the same maturity drop in priceincrease in yields as less people want it because it is less liquid you can look at historical prices yourself remember when you calculate yields with excel you need to input the coupon values x200b the next auctions are set for this thursday with a similar size of $62 billion on the 7yr and $61 billion on the 5yr why do these tenors matter apart from them having a certain amount of influence on the 10yr which drives the economy they are also beyond jpows promise of no rate hikes until 2023 a pesky thing called duration exists in the bond market basically yield movedurationinverse move in prices on zerocoupon and nearzerocoupon bonds like these the duration is basically the maturity this means on your new shiny 12 7yr treasury if in the near term rates go up 1 you are expected to have a 7 change on the new price that you can sell on the market many bond holders are expecting inflation and fed rate increases to go up in the next few years and thus are reluctant to buy now dropping the price and increasing interest rates which could set off an entire chain of yield repricings if jpow doesnt get off his sorry ass and gets brrrrrrrring x200b i expect rates to get hotter before we get ycc or some heavy purchases by the fed the feds actions with ending slr thus decreasing the amount of liquidity banks have on hand to do regular short term stuff like commercial paper and jpows disastrously noncommittalbrrrrrr interview makes me think the fed is allowing the market to do its job by tamping down on some exuberance the first to get hit by hotter rates is absolutely tech i have sold the bulk of my tech options and holdings i currently just have some gold shorts down to $1685 by april
334,84,2021-03-23 03:20:07,volatility skew in gme options tldr just another reason not to get jacked to the tits on 600 700 800calls market makers have hiked up the iv which means you can only buy 23rds the amount of calls vs flat skew thus reducing your ability to cause a gamma squeeze x200b additional detail skew is term to describe iv of outofthemoney strikes vs atthemoney typically you will either see flat skew all strikes similar iv or skew in the lower strikes higher iv sometimes you will see negative skew lower iv in higher strikes note i am simply going to say lower or higher strikes rather than calls puts since they are synthetically the same depending on how much stock you have so for you all you noobs a 11 covered call is synthetically the same as being short the same strike put this is primarily due to supplydemand since nearly everyone is net long when they get scared they might either paperhand their longs or buy lower strike puts when their stocks are going up they might sell higher strike calls covered calls but for gme the iv is much higher for the higher strikes this could be because too much demand either a apes going bananas or b people who want to get frontspread short at the money gamma needing to buy out the money protection so that they can show their risk manager they dont have unlimited risk not enough supply because no one is going to sell otm calls since they fear the planet of the apes pricegouging because they know the apes are priceinsensitive and need their heroine fix so just jack up the prices and the apes wont even know it do whatever you want i am rooting for the ape army but just be aware that creating a gamma squeeze is harder with the jacked up skew
2275,275,2021-03-28 14:55:45,buckle up we just saw a hedge fund die this week a trailer of the moass movie and explaining some weirdness friday dd hooo boy i just figured out something amazing you dirty apes buckle up because it is story time you are going to like this one this is not a story about gme now but what we will see happen during the moass how about a trailer to the movie we are about to see goldman sachs and block trades our story starts with an oddity someone pointed out to me friday there was a huge block trade being offered up on the bloomberg terminal what is a block trade it is when millions of shares are sold at once for a discount because they need to be liquidated for cash fast normally this big blocks trade in the dark market to not spook investors and allow big stockholders to exit without causing a panic one of the more benign reasons the dark markets exist so goldman sachs in this case does not actually own the stocks they are just selling them on behalf of some mysterious owner and are on the face of it lets dig deeper the man behind the curtain if you look at all those stocks they have one common entity which has enough stock for all of those trades morgan stanley not going to post all the links but ms is in the top 5 holders of every single one and is the only one with enough stock to sell those big of blocks cool one piece down but the thing is morgan stanleys balance sheet doesnt have any reason that they would have to liquidate that much risk so who could it be well yahoo broke the story the archegos capital management hedge fund is the apparent owner of all of those stocks it is run by bill hwang who used to own tiger asia management for those looking at other posts this is the common hong kong thread now the thing is not all hedge funds are necessarily evil but tiger had to shut down due to insider trading so fuckm credit to uthe_captain_slog for that find now archegos website is down too oh well the margin call and qqq so why did they get margin called well from the above links archegos is heavily leveraged so that means most of their holdings are bought on loan there is a capital requirement that they must fulfill in order to have this much leverage as a result of the 2008 crash where some players had 331 leverage cough bear stearns cough and died because of it taking the market with them due to the pandemic there was a temporary rule put in place saying that the treasury bonds didnt count against that limit it ends march 31st so they need a bit of cash so what well guess what they also own huge stakes in viacom and discovery these two stocks lost about 50 of their price over the last few days eliminating another huge portion of archegos equity value so now their debtequity ratio is a shitload higher what happens if the ratio gets too high the banks come acallin they force the hedge fund to close their leveraged positions and margin call them this margin call is also what happens to be the mechanism behind a short squeeze only a short squeeze has many margin calls happening back to back as their debt from short positions skyrockets well something really odd happened at the end of friday the spy and qqq etfs which are relatively low volatility climbed up a few percent in the last few hours traders have been super confused on why this happened but there is a really easy linkage here that isnt much of a stretch archegos was heavily shorting either the etfs or the underlying stocks so what happens when they get margin called they have to cover their positions suddenly at whatever price the stock is selling boom goes the stock price well little boom in this case but it is a mini preview of the moass this will be happening at a much bigger scale could it have been just normal portfolio rebalancing maybe but the timing of this works out really well and the narrative fits i am not a financial advisor cat nor jedi this is just a story about some other stocks and not financial advise

110,12,2021-03-24 08:03:52,$gme quarterly results 20192020 i am not a financial advisor my opinions are my own all earnings data has been pulled directly from the sec edgar filing database the march 23 report is much like the earnings call in fact one could say it was just a rehearsal of the details in the report aside from the financial results we see the board appointments and jenna owens as chief operating officer it doesnt specify who the all important chief tech officer will be but other sources confirm matt francis theyve massively reduced shortterm debt however this quarter has not seen a change it seems in long term debt one thing i thought was really cool that isnt mentioned in the report is the introduction of a larger selection of gaming peripherals chairs keyboards desks into their product lineup the ceo mentioned this and i think its important that they want to escape the cyclical console releasebased model theyve functioned under in order to take in more consistent customer flow twitch is growing massively and will continue to grow as more and more people are pulled into the incredibly lucrative platform this growth will push sales of vr gear keyboards mice monitors and desks all of these products will be prime product categories for gme in the near and long term one other thing that was emphasized was increased efficiency in logistics and order fulfillment i assume this is a callback to the recent struggle with nextgen console supply i think the appointment of both a chief tech officer and chief operating officer who worked previously with amazon is a clear signal that theyre pushing heavily to dominate the ecommerce gaming space and massively cut down on inefficiencies in their fulfillment pipeline altogether in my opinion these administrative changes along with the clearly healthy financial condition of the company give it a solid foundation to build up their online platform and offer better deals to customers in order to remain truly competitive in the market
1029,72,2021-03-24 08:02:59,gme my easy to understand and short fundamentals analysis march 24 not a financial advice i did company valuations before and have gotten pretty accurate estimates while im doing this valuation on gme i can tell that i like the fundamentals of gamestop just think about it 1 stating the obvious but would any of these senior leadership with massive backgrounds go work in a sinking ship of course not gamestop for the long run 2 the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of 11 and no one is positioned to take over that market like gamestop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry 3 ecommerce sales of gamestop accounts for 32 of all sales in just a year this is insanely good reducing the brick and mortar side of business and increasing the online one is how its gonna be going forward and this is all done under the supervision of ecommerce geniuses who built startups from scratch 4 when gamestop closes many of their stores that cost a lot of money per year theyll cut down on staffing rents and utilities which in turn will reduce their overall costs and increase their margins they can even reduce margin on consoles and other accessories to the extent where its perfect competition with amazon and ignite that huge used products market its late here and i have to sleep but theres a lot more that makes me believe this company is worth much more than chewy zalando and other ecommerce platforms not a financial advice but heres how im thinking about it
244,146,2021-03-24 06:58:00,amc big picture ampampx200b yes today was a tough day but take a step back and take a look at the bigger picture we have formed a very nice ascending channel since feb 5 and have tested the bottom at least 5 times today we reached the bottom and the chart is already showing signs of a bounce we are looking to hold $1050 support bottom of the channel and failing that we have very strong support at $10 well see at open tomorrow but it will take considerable sell or short pressure to push it down by more than 5 we may have lost some ground but we have solid support at the $1000 price retards this shit is about to pull out the uno reverse card and make the hedgies sweat if you already paperhanded amcgmefuck youbut now is your chance to jump back on the rocket with gme news about to flood the media i would expect a nice green day tomorrow have faith apes the squeeze isnt happening this week but we are building up to it i have the first two weeks of april marked on my calendar for the squeeze although only the hedge funds have an idea of when it will happen right now they are trying to bluff you off the rocket so hodl if i was to compare it to january i would say this looks similar to january 26th take a look at the macd and rsi do you see what i see see how much room we are giving ourselves to run this shit is about to get wild edit added some rockets and thanks for the award thats my first one

4445,455,2021-03-24 03:46:39,gamestop can only go up x200b technical analysis doesnt mean too much to gme but it certainly tells us something i think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the earnings report coming later today here are some a few key indicators why gme can and will go up dramatically soon x200b 1 hour technical analysis x200b 1 rsi the first point id like to touch on is rsi as you can see the rsi is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when gme was making its comeback from the drop to $40 now look at the rsi at the same price today and youll see that we are heading towards being oversold what does this mean its simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase 2 trend in terms of the month we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks from the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area its starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area the current trend we are in is a bullish descending triangle much like the pennant we saw earlier 3 volume with gme when volume goes up price goes up if you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up the price tends to skyrocket right now volume is extremely low a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further 4 turning point with the rsi trend and volume all pointing towards future rapid growth im inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon i do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point and the only way i see it getting to that area is massive short selling to artificially drop the price x200b conclusion the technicals point toward gme skyrocketing in the near future take this all with a grain of salt though the price could very well drop below the areas ive mentioned before going up above all else hodl and the tendies shall come x200b update 3232021 658 et looks like the price was driven down after a relatively good earnings report cant say it was totally unexpected but it certainly threw many of us off the price was starting to break upwards only to be violently thrown downwards iborrowdesk shows that 50k shares were borrowed and likely contributed to this selling pressure the price did bounce off of $150 like previously mentioned after getting down to around 1520 rsi theyre now in a very oversold territory but it wouldnt surprise me if they kept trying to artificially lower the price the shorts arent going to give up so easily so hooooodlllll fellow apes 
2187,191,2021-03-25 05:28:45,the gme rsi hasnt been this low since the day rc tweeted frog ice cream the price was $45 then hello fellow idiots i wanted to share my smoothbrained observation that gme is oversold at this moment gme its oversold x200b wow great fucking observation you x200b the reason this is worth noting is because of the difference in price on the day of frog ice cream tweet vs today x200b 2242021 rc tweeted frog ice cream low of $45 rsi of 46 3242021 day after 2020 q4 earnings low of $125 at time of writing rsi of 43 the day of rcs tweet and following day had a cumulative volume of 233m shares and the price increased from a low of $45 to a high of $185 closing at $109 x200b okay whats a smooth brain to do with this type of data x200b the answer make a wild guesstimate about potential future price movement a crude calculation todays low $125 two day price increase after rcs frog ice cream tweet 400 $500 well ill be damned isnt that a nice looking number with the current fundamental outlook and turnaround story that is unfolding before our eyes my belief is that there is high potential for additional catalysts coming in the next year months weeks or even days id venture to say it can be a catalyst that triggers even more buying volume than frog ice cream the timing is what we cant know x200b whats my conclusion my calculation is crude and theoretical the price could go back to $10 for all i know but jeffries just raised the pt to $175 there are a ton of potential catalysts coming and gme rsi is in oversold territory i heard from someone with a wrinkle that low rsi good time to buy take care you fucks
565,103,2021-03-25 01:54:47,putting the gme short squeeze and the gamma into context interesting take from forbes on the gme squeeze and how it potentially relates to the rest of the market going forward whos next for your convenience ive copied the authors summary tldr below it sounds smart so maybe someone with a curvy brain can explain what it all means regarding the specifics of the gme event the liquidation of the overdrawn short interest in gme contributed to the january surge but was not decisive the short interest played a minimal role in the february surge which was a more pure example of the gamma process regarding the broader significance of all this the gamma process seems to be quite powerful the optioncosttoshareprice leverage is real and significant the process does not depend strictly on the short interest to fuel the squeeze the maneuver may therefore soon be extended to other companies that do not necessarily have a large short interest
371,101,2021-03-25 08:43:13,jefferies upped gme to $175 from $15 but they have a huge conflict of interest ill post the report here once if i get access since i can sometimes get jefferies research but you can read a summary here basically theyre citing a boom in ecommerce and making the case that there will be a successful pivot this is by far the most bullish upgrade weve seen though wedbush doubling to $30 from $16 is significant in its own right 100 increase in fair value from their view unfortunately there is a major conflict of interest with jefferies bank analyst are called sellside because they sell research reports and dont manage stock portfolios they sell these research reports to the buyside but the majority of their income is derived by helping bankers win deals and traders get volume to their desk technically speaking its illegal for research and banking to intertwine but its not an uncommon practice for bankers to imply to smaller clients that their research analyst might initiate or maintain coverage if they raise capital through them ive seen research analysts discontinue coverage on names only to cite a lack of potential to monetize via banking as the reason the other way is by generating trade revenues which is selfexplanatory sales sends around the research note and pitch an idea then the execution traders place the order sometimes after further coaxing from research the reason jefferies is sketchy is because they are the firm through which gme has the standing atm agreement basically jefferies can raise capital for gme by selling new shares into the open market this is effectively a hybrid of a banking equity capital markets and sales and trading desk in other words this is something that directly monetizes research its not a huge leap to see how gme longs could get screwed in this scenario gme discloses an atm agreement yesterday then suddenly the bank that can raise capital for gme at market price releases a super bullish report with a price target well above the current market price its not a leap to see how they benefit in this outcome given theyll be comped on a percentage of the deal be careful out there edit i didnt see this when i posted but this also comes after gme stated theyre considering upping the atm equity line so the bullish report comes after signs the deal could be even more profitable than before likely in the event the price remained elevated

215,130,2021-03-27 09:17:11,dd part 2 i counted all the wallstreetbets gme yolos gains and loss porn hi everyone if you missed my first post i spent a stupid amount of time manually counting wsb yolos since i already wasted a ton of time i decided i would waste some more and count the gme gain and loss porn posts that hadnt closed their position as well as new yolos from today a few posters were upset at me collecting positions but my logic is this is knowledge that is likely available to and collected by the short side and thus it is good for everyone here to have the same transparency x200b a few things have become obvious from this process 1 is this is by no means a holistic accounting of these posts it has become clear to me i am missing a lot it was pointed out that our admin team purges any yolo below 25k as well users potentially purging their own posts or me just missing them so this isnt meant to be all encompassing just an interesting insight x200b i kept the same slightly unrealistic assumption of 100 of posters having diamond hands interestingly of the de duped data only 1 user decreased their position while all the others either kept the same positions or increased it often literally doubling down x200b i included users who shared their position in my original post to validate my silent whale theory these positions arnt confirmed with a screenshot and i dont 100 trust all of them but oh well the data since yesterday i was able to collect an additional 106 positions holding 87754 shares with a mean holding of 731 shares this bringing the total number of positions collected to 261 holding 339958 shares if we believe the available float is 27m this means only 261 kongs hold 125 of all float again this isnt all encompassing and doesnt even start to account for the potential millions of other apes holding gme in my last post i postulated about the rule of 1 on the internet and i personally believe this applies in the case of these yolos and reddit in general this in my opinion account for a legion of silent kongs and whales just for fun if we apply the 1990 ratio for content creator upvoter and viewer we can make a some what irresponsible estimate at 19 2349 wsb kongs hold 3059622 shares x200b at 190 23490 wsb kongs hold 30596220 shares x200b again just estimates but this isnt even accounting for god knows how many of the 95m wsb apes who hold 110 shares or close connections of these apes who arnt even on wsb no way of knowing for sure but i personally believe retail owns very close to all the float or all of it if people want the data i pulled anonymized to run further analysis i can share it tdlr 261 kongs hold 339958 share or 125 of all float gamestops site lists float as 54m so with that number these 261 kongs own 0627 of float edit was pointed out gamestops site lists float as 542m and the other numbers of float 45m 27m 19m are likely inaccurate so updating above
1563,154,2021-03-27 07:26:29,i still believe in a bullish bias for gme technical analysis some of you all might be disappointed that we didnt have a crazy bull day like yesterday take a step back and look at the hourly time frame gme had a huge 50 day yesterday and dropped only 2 today this is just healthy consolidation on low daily volume this is what bulls want rsi has cooled down on hourly its holding moving average supports and im thinking it will go back and retest todays highs next week you want this to stairstep up when we dont have low volume and when big money steps in notice how much room cmf has to curl up then thats the big 20 30 40 days

1290,139,2021-03-27 00:32:24,greater fool theory and its implications to gme hey kids today we are going to talk about greater fool theory investopedia defines greater fool theory as follows the greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price now you may be thinking are we the greater fools i bought at 250 like a good little ape and my answer is no first lets acknowledge that gme is not worth $200 or $300 or $42069 or $8008101 we arent betting on the actual value were betting on the greater fools were betting on the short squeeze and its day will come the shorts will have to buy no matter the price so in this scenario they are the greatest fools of all melvin shitron and other hfs will devolve below the monke and turn into single celled organisms only capable of breeding and shitting how can i confirm this lets do some retard math the average iq defined in the wechsler intelligence scale is 90109 and since were smooth brained and in the extremely low category were defined as 69 and below so lets say were all 69nice there are 9665680 rwsb members at the time of writing multiply total users by 69 and we get 666931920 with our combined monke iqs we have decided we like the stock melvin has 33 employees who well say are in the superior iq classification of 130 and above using maths we can conclude their combined iq is 4290 so who is the greater fool melvin who doesnt like the stock with an iq of 4290 or rwsb with a combined retard strength of 666931920 who like stonk so get your chickens ready the deep fryer is heating up and tendies will be ready soon this is not financial advice

1383,195,2021-03-27 11:50:03,$gme potential pattern cup with handle analysis part 2 bullish handle breakout analysis macd wr dmi based analysis with other examples this time first things first here is where we are with some pretty lines drawn in x200b second things second lets take a look at the updated conditions we discussed in the first post according to investopedia there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern x200b 1 trend to qualify as a continuation pattern a prior trend should exist ideally the trend should be a few months old and not too mature check 2 cup the cup should be u shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom a v shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify check 3 cup depth ideally the depth of the cup should retrace 13 or less of the previous advance however with volatile markets and overreactions the retracement could range from 13 to ½ kinda check we fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement and so we need to be a little wary and i still stand by this updated however at this point we can say gme is not a textbook example so the depths might be less of a factor 4 handle after the high forms on the right side of the cup there is a pullback that forms the handle sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward other times it is just a short pullback the handle represents the final consolidationpullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 13 of the cups advance but usually not more the smaller the retracement the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout kinda check again updated at this point it may be safe to say that the textbook depths do not really apply we have fallen out of 13 and even 12 depths and there is reason to be wary however this might not really matter for gme 5 duration the cup can extend from 1 to 6 months sometimes longer on weekly charts the handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 14 weeks almost there updated check 6 volume there should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handles resistance updated 50 million volume to go from closing 120 to closing 180 there is definitely momentum here previous resistance of 172 broken check okay so now lets look at the handle x200b we can see here that di and di are diverging signaling bullish sentiment wr slipped into a strong overselling signal on 324 and then on 325 it moved sharply towards the middle this means the stock is starting to be more bought than sold the macd histogram is growing in momentum 324 being the most negative day so great it looks like there could be a breakout forming here but now what how long does it go for and what can we expect well lets look at historical examples here is the textbook investopedia example wynn on monthly candles x200b we can see that when there is a breakout in the handle the bullish movement pushed the price to go above previous cup resistances however after the breakout the price of the stock free falls down almost to previous cup support levels x200b okay now you may be saying this is so zoomed out and candles are months ect ect ect this is simply the investopedia textbook example lets look at another more recent one here is nvda on daily candles x200b here is what happened after the run up as you can see this stock kept running up after the handle breakout x200b all of this is just information i hope you take it with a grain of salt if a true cup with handle pattern forms and the breakout of the handle happens then we know prices run up at least to the previous resistance until that happens its hard to say whats next edit words obligatory emojis

936,181,2021-03-30 05:12:11,what morgan stanleys offering of rkt 20m share block at $2525 means ms is liquidating stocks to recover capital including a 20m share block of rkt instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for viac and chinese stocks ms knows if they do this for rkt they will decimate rkts stock price because this is like 15 of the float so they are selling it as a block trade usually they would price this below market value because they want to recover capital quickly especially on a volatile stock like rkt just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value however they are offering at a 5 premium to the market price at the time of offering this means two important things 1 ms thinks fair value of rkt is above $2525 they know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed 2 if someone buys it they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying short interest for rkt has been rising and was above gme end of last week normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you dont gain much value but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a lot from doing a short squeeze another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value above $2525 something big is brewing with rkt and be ready for it to explode edit apparently the shares are already sold out now

1762,106,2021-04-05 15:00:08,institutional investors recently buying gme and not exiting full position i wanted to take a deeper look into gme and what the hedge funds have been doing recently with the stock i know a lot of you have your doubts about fintel but i have a membership account and i dont believe all the data should be dismissed i was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in gamestop if we take a look at institutional ownership there have been no fully executed exited positions with hedge funds recently are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble i believe so heres some data to back that claim up edit i had to remove the screenshots from fintel but i can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently if you take a look at gme stock during the dates of 25mar2021 27mar2021 and then compare that to the buys from fintel you can see there is a correlation i believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock unfortunately for them it did not work and gme quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180 this leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before edit or they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip we all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they dont get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction in my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows that is why i always encourage to buy shares not options when one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker in this case it would be citadels market maker division where do you think those earnings go to thats why i only buy shares with cash never on margin also a tip use the indicator accumulationdistribution indicator for analyzing charts indicator available in yahoo finance anything above a 5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect its price that dramatically anything under an accumulationdistribution indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock this is not financial advice i just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future may god bless all of you your aperetard
458,233,2021-04-05 09:11:41,$aso is a powder keg will blow soon $aso is academy sports and outdoors they are a sports equipment store and a hunting store that sells guns ammo i would describe them similar to dicks but more focused on their core selling points they arent spending money making their stores look like a extravegent mall i have been too aso many times and overall enjoy their store from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out aso ipod in october of 2020 aso is a fundamentally undervalued stock last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling eps estimated was 46 and actual was 109 their revenue increased as well their net sales increased 18 over last year they have a market cap of 263 b and trade at a pe of 766 as compared to dicks which trades at a pe of 1385 as you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers ipo lockup period ended on 331 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished postive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shorters of the stock had hoped for the stock has been shorted from the start because i believe it was just lumped into the typical brick mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping this was a grave miscalculation as aso provides a niche varitey of products that the online space is not fulfiilling adequetly their top compeitor dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo they have a current short interest of 39 with a public float of 31 m the stock currently is at a all time high of $29 that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions with some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with rkt i dont see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that gme had but i do see a substaintial price increase soon if the right factors materialize open interest for 416 30 strike calls are huge and if the volume comes in and pushes the stock up we could be looking at quite the squeeze for this bad boy tldr aso is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ath with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze positions 9 416 30 strike 2 416 25 strike calls x200b this is not financial advice spend your money however you choose
3960,454,2021-04-04 18:11:49,institutions in gme increased 2 than last month rc owns 4 times more shares than george based on simplywallst i dig through some data and noticed some changes last month instituiton ownership was 70 and now there is 2 more than last month this is chart to show top shareholders and rc owns right after blackrock which is the largest investment company in the world beside george sherman who is current ceo has way lower than rc therefore by looking at this top shareholder data i believe rc will be soon take over ceo position of gme and i am looking forward to hear his public announcement and we see you in the moon

0,112,2021-04-02 07:09:38,youre probably playing gme wrong x200b not bad for a days work x200b if youre sitting there week after week waiting for a short squeeze holy shit youre playing this wrong twice a week monday and friday i daytrade the fuck out of gme its not uncommon for me to make a tens of thousands or todays case nearly 200k the stock is stupid volatile and follows the same fucking pattern every single day do you ever wonder if all the people telling you to hodl might _not_ be on your side if you retail lock up the float the big boyz can also manipulate the price up do you seriously think the shorts havent managed their risk by now for fucks sake you all post the dd here publicly my biggest regret is not selling in the january spike my second biggest was not selling in march i rectified all that by just dumping it all and hopping in and out constantly and before you say if hes in im inyou dummy he already sold a portion of his assets and made millions i cant wait for a maybe short squeeze i want money now wasnt that the point of this sub have fun holding and getting worked up over literally nothing x200b edit regarding positions from a comment i made below 10m is the buying power from margin so i have a fourth of that 3m i started with 50k in november and grew it over the months 12 20 25 40 70 210 and then started day trading positions from 2k 10k from there i usually mess around in the 5000 share range and only go 10000 if i need to average down for example if i bought 5000 at 180 it falls to 170 ill buy another 5000 putting me at 175 and then jump out at like 177 thats $20k right there gme is so volatile in the bands and the good news is bullish so im usually not worried about the rug being pulled out from under me i had bought at 175 i think last week and then just dumped it all today at 195 got back in at 189 and then dumped it again at 194
456,206,2021-04-02 06:15:14,$aso and why you apes are gonna be mad you missed this one alright lets get right into this $aso known as academy sports and outdoors is a large nationally run sports equipment n shit like that store im poetic i know academy has 259 stores nationwide but wants to see that grow to over 800 they just report earnings this week and absolutely smashed earnings eps projected 46 actual was 109 they also beat revenue projections from 156b to 16b not much but still improved their net sales was 569nicebillion a 18 increase over the prior year in comparison dicks sporting goods which has substantially more stores only improved 95 yoy considering the fact that all of last year basically every single sport was canceled and yet they still destroyed earnings has me happier than a kid on christmas morning every single team sport that was shut down last year is back for business this year baby which means more money for $aso oh they also sell a shit ton of guns and ammo which is obviously a big deal in todays political scenario now you say okay whys that matter this stock has been trading for only a couple months well heres where things get interesting this is a disclaimer i do not care how high a company is shorted unless there is substantial evidence that would convince me that due to the high short interest and the proponents of a good run company that the price will increase this is that scenario short interest is at 39 public float is 31m and market cap is 2b 91 days to cover read those numbers again then wipe your ass cause you probably shit yourself now i dont want to taunt this as the next gme cause its not i am simply bringing attention to a company with almost 900 million cash on hand and the fact that every single motherfucking short is currently underwater yup you read that right every single short that has been opened in this stock is currently underwater unless $aso screws up big time these shorts will have no choice but to cover pos 416 $30c edit i forgot to mention 92 is owned by institutions edit wsb mods banned me for 69 days for paper trading when ive never paper traded a day in my life lmfao what a fucking joke nobody like a jerkoff mod if anyone has questions please message me the mods are fake and gay and banned me so i cant reply to anything edit x3 the share lockup period ended two days ago you see where it went from $27 to $24at open ya that was the lockup period people are worried about its already done and gone edit x4 i just discovered the dollar volume sold short is $309 million divide that by the shares shorted of 125 million and you find the average dollar cost of the short position is at $25 they are so fucked
249,68,2021-04-02 04:22:20,dd aso options ladder is enticing high short interest good earnings this data is based off of shortsight paid real time short data from s3 partners as we can see in the last few weeks short interest in aso spiked to 44 aso killing earnings on 330 all time high net income 157 increase yy 311 increases yy on adjusted net income 97 eps for a 304 increase yy i see this as a reopening play potential for a gamma squeeze gamma squeeze pressure on shorts to close as weve seen w stocks like gme options provide more leverage than holding shares for moving a stocks price if there are a chain of strike prices w high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain in this case $25 was the first link while at the time of writing it is now $2834 it can cause a reaction where mm need to delta hedge these options by buying shares as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums which increase the stocks price which lets us hit the next link in the chain etc etc forbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to gme as we can see open interest is also high on options ex 19000 calls on 416 for $30 if the stock can nearhit $30 it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by mms this will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43 all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price $23 shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards reopening play dicks sporting goods no longer sells guns in texas as people go out more reignite their hobbies aso will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns even as a long term hold instead of playing the options chain this seems like a good play the play i think theres potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 416 the open interest is there the catalyst is there run up in stock price due to amazing earnings and theres the additional high short interest which means if things moon theyll moon even harder the options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well the bear case the earnings report isnt enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 416 another catalyst doesnt come or the market in general corrects as we are at ath in this case the call option ladder will fail to materialize positions 200 416c w $30 strike price

14,124,2021-04-08 05:32:47,uh guys why is no one talking about cheesecake factory what drives the reaction to an earnings call is guidance not revenue or profit some of you dummies may have found that out the hard way condolences to those that did im not going to do that thing you see on investors hub or that we started seeing here when gme popped off inundating you with so much info that you skip it and think gee this must be a good play sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one black folk like cheesecake factory white folk like cheesecake factory asian folk like cheesecake factory hispanic folk like cheesecake factory vaccines are rolling out lots of areas are going to be fully open by mid june cheesecake factory is in a sweet spot costwise poor mans ruths chrismortons and a rich mans mcdonalds accessible to many liked by all $cake sitting around $60 at the moment 65cs with a late may expiry are goin for around $200 seems like a pretty decent speculative play it should run up as the country opens and the guidance for summer is usually the best of the four seasons great guidance on the earnings call first week of may can push this to 80 by july 4th easily my two cents not investment advice

68,71,2021-04-12 12:09:18,$wwe wrestling a play on collectables reopening against the odds growth shorts wwe isnt that that the industry where grown men fondle each other for a living yes yes it is they are listed on the new york stock exchange and have been under the radar for a while despite all they have going for them coming into this week part 1 collectables as you read this world wrestling entertainment is holding their 37th annual wrestlemania event over this weekend from saturday to sunday what makes this one different well for one its the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since the start of covid however im more interested in their newly acquired money printer enter the world of collectables where tweets go for $25 million pixels sell for millions and your local mailman is scrambling to sell their farts as collectables for $400 a piece the nba was quick to take advantage of this craze selling a collectable of lebron james for $200000 and has seen $230 million spent in trading on their platform whats the profit margin on something like this what could be the cost of creating these pixels as you probably guessed its an unsurprising near 100 profit margin collectables are making a comeback and wwe has been quick to notice they have for the first time released a set of them this weekend to accompany wrestlemania 37 as i write this their silver card have sold out at a total price tag of $37000 the gold currently has a bid of over $13000 lastly platinum has a whopping $100000 bid with 4 hours left to go this marks only the beginning of something that will grow to a multimillion dollar revenue stream for wwe collectables sell and when you have such a cult following as the wwe crowd theres no shortage of people willing to pay big money for ownership the media has been covering various sales recently and we could see media attention in the upcoming week once the sales are closed out tonight part 2 reopening in 2019 wwe had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds in 2020 they had 42 q4 earnings fell 26 from q4 2019 revenue was 2382 million eps of 16 cents pretty well below expectations now that shouldnt be all that shocking nobody could go see the shows 2021 will tell a different story this weekends wrestlemania 37 is the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since covid19 started the company has announced a sell out crowd of 25675 fans in attendance for wrestlemania 37 and the crowds will only get larger from here it is already rumored that wrestlemania 69 is set to take place on mars putting aside the obvious upcoming growth wwe has already seen a year over year increase in operating income to 3325 million a near 74 increase from 2019 all of that with covid how could that be the bulk of that increase is coming from rises in content fees wwe knows what they are doing they are smart with their money and are ready to slingshot into orbit with oldlive audiences and newcollectables revenue streams just now coming into play which brings me to my next point wwe has been in an agreement with saudi arabia to do two shows per year the cost is $50 million per show these shows didnt happen in 2020 and wwe was not paid their due $100 million instead wwe has extended the contract until shows can resume and this agreement lasts for ten years now $100 million doesnt seem like a lot in the context of a company with a 4b market cap but considering that wwe raised its operating income by nearly 74 percent to 3325 million without the expected $100 million from the saudis is nothing short of impressive how can a company that should have been held down so much during covid just keep prospering part 3 shorts i know what most of you are probably thinking gme first or its heavily shorted but i just couldnt leave this one out nearly 20 of the float is short with 7 days to cover this is a prime example of a stock that is turning everything around and is about to go ballistic in terms of revenue now im not saying a squeeze is imminent but its not out of the realm of possibility with all the news and new revenue i see many exiting their positions this upcoming week gradually driving the price higher this is a stock that has hardly been touched by retail investors and has 40 insider ownership so the possibilities are endless disclaimer im a retard just like anyone else on here so obviously do your own research before jumping in read the entire post its a shit tldrtldr wwe is taking full advantage of the collectable craze and their cult following this weekend as they release their first collectables with bids already at $100000 they just keep financially prospering in a time when they should be suffering 2020 was their most profitable year in wwe history despite no live audiences this weekends wrestlemania is the first show to bring in a live audience since covid started selling out and bringing in over 25000 fans and this is just the beginning revenue is about to explode from live shows collectables and reopening the cherry on top is the 20 short that is going to send this to the stratosphere this week positions wwe shares and $5k worth of 416 60 strike calls in my ira individual and rh play account edit editupdate wwe collectables just closed out everything has been sold out salesplatinum 100k gold 27k silver 37k bronze retro 907k bronze

122,49,2021-04-09 07:09:46,palantir demo day april 14th calls hey so if anyone remembers pltr demo day in january 26th turned out to be a huge success they showed some new features and focused on how they normally show off new feature releases for their customers they also gave us a little something with what i like to call the xcom global defense demo it literally fking rocked the stock was hovering at $3432$3687 through the day and closed at $3537 kinda nonspectacularly however what happened the next day was a huge surprise to everyone since the stock surged to the ath $45 before closed at $39 this new demo coming on april 14th next wednesday is the first in a series of demos sounds like some more in depth about how it works hopefully its not just a bunch of doods with crappy microphones reading off a boring ass script in their kitchen again do you think well see another pop im semi doubtful since it seems a lot of sentiment has shifted over to gme but it looks like the volume is super low $pltr hasnt seen major trading volume for nearly a month i bought a bunch of shares at $9 back in early october and bought some more when it was in the teens i feel like dumping some to buy dorifto car for the summer but if theyre gonna pop next week i might hold on to them a little longer
232,208,2021-04-21 06:41:22,short sellers never learn theyre doubling down on clov dd at this point seems a lot of people know about clov just so happens that the catalyst was a data error but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isnt 144 of float after all its now estimated at over 43 making clov still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market if not the most shorted stock now i actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago i first became aware of clov in the midst of the january hype but i dont like buying high so i stayed away came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $650 and bought in around $7 myself a few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point i think the doj investigation accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock the average price target among analysts was at something like $1350 at the time with no analysts labeling it a sell that is super promising for longterm holds the market opportunity itself clov is one of those will make it big or will die trying kind of stocks i think they can make it in the space but its uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors keeping the price down until their results start showing the continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias so i was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness needless to say seemed like a home run a nice value opportunity for a longterm hold then i became aware of the short interest friday i saw my position exploding and had to look into why saw the 144 short interest report and increased my position by like 10x this was no longer just a buy and hold for a high longterm gain but could really explode up quickly turns out the short interest wasnt quite accurate but ironically this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from clov going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly the most shorted stock on the market in terms of float heres where it stands now according to ortex with a 90 util rate just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point shorts have basically maxed out their position making up about 43 of the technical float however a large portion of the float is not actually available given the information available on their most recent 10k it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiderscontrolling investors this leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the real available float this is likely why the util rate is at 90 despite less than half of the shares being on loan were at an effective short interest of roughly 75 and rising yall i liked this stock before this whole thing but now i love it this is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts i dont want to say its the next gme because obviously gme actually was shorted all the way past 100 of float and was a turnaround story itself gme also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen i was in gme in feb and march of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in dec i never imagined it might go into the $40s much less $400 i dont see this as a turnaround story so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of chamath and general spac distaste for me this is a value play thats been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze full disclosure i currently hold 300 shares one 21 may 75 c one 18 jun 7 c one 20 aug 125 c im also waiting on a deposit to clear with which i plan to purchase a leap i may roll my may call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things ps to top it all off im a giant fan of the wyckoff method the daily chart looks like a great wyckoff setup right now with todays pullback to the neckline area providing a promising potential lps
147,190,2021-04-20 19:40:20,the mental game hey wsb apes i am seeking advice on how some people on here deal with the stress or panic of losses and avoid selling not necessarily gme but with every other stock also i know alot of you have rules of entry and exit but even then i am sure there is a mental battle to either panic sell and then buy on the rise i have done it too many times lol now i am getting to the point of not wanting to be involved or invest because of the stress it has given me the past 2 months even though i am up money i am stressed over the potential gains i missed out on especially when i knew better so how do you guys deal with the stress and remove emotion from the stocks because emotions lead to losses in my case
106,54,2021-04-20 05:41:00,dd mvis go brrrr and i dont care which way my mediumterm bull case for mvis x200b tldr buy mvis shares sell way otm monthly covered calls for absurd premiums x200b disclaimer i wrote this sunday night after i decided on my course of action i did not post until now because i wanted to actually do the trades before posting the dd the numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly x200b im fucking new at this i got in with gme i admit it im probably completely fucked on this thesis and i encourage you all to shit all over it so that i dont lose all my tendies on some batshit weedinduced fantasy i dont know what im doing and if you follow me youre literally retarded that being said x200b i yolod my entire net worth on mvis today im poor so this was only 500 shares but fuck you we all start somewhere i just started late and waited some more and then missed the bus x200b positions 3 gme 238 500 mvis 1149 avg 5 mvis 521 18c 070 premium realized x200b the most important factor in my thesis is the high iv of mvis looking back at the last year the iv and hv have been consistently high which given the incredibly swingy nature of this wsb stock is not unexpected x200b in my research which was probably halfassed and woefully inadequate a high iv is a stock with above 60 or so and the top few are above 100 mvis is at 160 historically for the last year this is not abnormal for mvis gme is also around 160 right now x200b high iv means that the options chain is often very expensive lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums x200b lets do some quick and dirty math x200b for our purposes we will use may 21 exp x200b gme current 155 521 300c is 835 strike 193 current price mvis current 11 521 20c is 080 strike 182 current price rkt current 22 521 30c is 026 strike 136 current price x200b so lets look at a metric that probably has a name i dont know premium stock price this tells me that for every dollar i have invested into a stock i can earn that amount for the option this lets me rate options based on what i expect returns to be for selling covered calls x200b gme 5387 mvis 7273 rkt 1182 iv is 60 x200b at 727 returns on a monthly option if mvis were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high iv for a year you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price x200b if mvis drops it will retain its high iv and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds or you can trade the high iv to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you hopefully turning a profit in the end youre a paper handed bitch too x200b if mvis spikes you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares sure you could have bought calls instead of selling them but i want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them x200b mvis is currently dirt cheap at $11 and has been red all month i think its close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks x200b x200b x200b ok so lets talk potential gains and losses x200b because my position is shares my losses are fairly limited as i believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts i saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that itll just never drop past again ever therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5share if i can get 080 premiums every month then in six months ive basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape or double down and keep selling the iv this ill do this its just a dip buy more x200b if the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its iv then i continue to sell calls until i think i can get higher gains elsewhere and i exit the position with less profit than i had hoped but no losses x200b if the stock spikes but does not pass my strike i roll the options out and possibly up and try to capitalize on the short term spike in iv and premiums i keep holding until either the iv or stock price drops below levels i am happy with x200b if the stock spikes past my strike currently $18 then i am assigned and exit the trade $3250 plus any premiums i got x200b in summary i dont care if this stock moons plunges or charts a path like the fucking evergiven as long as its iv stays high im just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me x200b im pretty confident in this so im probably fucked please teach me if you want charts and graphs fuck you do your own dd if you want rocket emojis this thread is accepting donations x200b edited to show actual s reflective of my trading today
396,442,2021-04-18 07:17:06,extremely thorough clov recent action dd im going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how clov was directly related to gme squeeze so when gme was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more those two people were elon musk and chamath palihapitiya both partners in previous endeavors and friends gme squeeze hurt short seller hindenburg so much that they have lost 40 of their account that week clov is backed by chamath palihapitiya hindenburg in order to retaliate at chamath for causing them huge losses published a short seller report for clov few days after chamath tweeted about gme short seller report had very little base yet that caused the stock to drop and also sec had to initiate an investigation due to the claims since then stock got beaten down to less than ipo prices what does that mean it means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock but mostly by short sellers that will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading enough of history retail following since gme endeavor chamath palihapitiya joined the club of retail gods he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers his previous partnerships with elon musk furthers retail following so now not only we have gme crowd supporting chamath but also tesla crowd both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history fridays hindenburgs fright with clov on friday clov has opened with 148 short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started the volume topped 250m shares traded 10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day ill get in to more technicals later but needed to mention this to push the narrative hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that factset has misleading short interest data about clov not including ceos clad b shares in the float factset came back to hindenburgs allegations with a reply that ceos type b shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float and once again confirmed that stock is 148 short this further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit a lot of people didnt catch on on friday but through the night and this afternoon reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it videos are popping up on youtube a lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet monday open technicals clov free float is 109mil clov shares outstanding are 406mil 78 of clov shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days institutional ownership of clov is at 48 the volume on friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61 turn over for shares outstanding but if you take locked up shares out of consideration true turn over was actually 228 meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on friday a lot of people that bought on friday including next financial group that bought 21400 shares will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing in my speculation out of 109 mil free float only around 35 of shares will be available to trade this week here is how i got to this number institutions owe 48 of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations but giving it a benefit of doubt lets say that institutions that will hold account only to 30 of float now we only have 70 of float left to trade lets assume that investors that owe clov long term account for 20 of the float a lot of them dont check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly lets assume that half of them even wont notice what is happening this week at this point we only have 50 of float left to trade the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers day traders swing traders and diamond handers this is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold i believe this group will contribute to another 15 of float being unavailable assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding so my conclusion is only 35 of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again thats only 38mil shares not being stuck in someones account semi permanently some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in but i wont take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point fallowing all this speculative yet very carefully vetted math lets calculate the demand for the shares just to close short positions 148 of the free float is shorted meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 024 shares so looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 101 following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze well the answer is its mathematically impossible to calculate although there are some indicators of what people can expect smaller the float the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go in this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors even if its impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit its possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management monitoring volume daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate to know when short squeeze is ending i monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with but in reverse meaning volume will start to tapper off short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt i also watch out for extremely sudden needle like falls trailing stop loss domino effect i hope the read was interesting and i havent lost you half way through i wont go into any clov fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause i think we already established that everything is in order there it is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze
146,117,2021-04-17 12:54:42,i think $rycey rolls royce is very undervalued somewhat new retard here and dont post very much at all that being said simply based on former peaks in its past $rycey has great potential to in the next 5ish years to have a major rebound were not talking to gme level gains but a cool 10x also despite recent troubles between corona weighing hard on flight travel increased travel regulations and internal struggles with new products that they will survive based on necessity of englands national security i think its a company that will receive help through their troubles and is bound to resurge with the hopeful success of the vaccines once again im retarded and now please feel free to tell me just how retarded that may be my wifes boyfriend has the bed for the weekend
1449,454,2021-04-17 11:09:31,i counted all the gme yolos part 3 hi everyone in case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here part 1 part 2 to summarize i am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions i have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions this could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they wont post either way pretty interesting i am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions i have recorded no one has paper handed previously i had recorded 261 yolos holding 339958 shares updated data since then i have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of 473 positions representing 576433 shares with current after hours share prices of $16081 these shares represent $9269619073 or for those that cant read big numbers 927 million as i had mentioned in my previous posts i personally believe the rule of 1 on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10100 that are silent just for fun if we apply the 1990 ratio for content creator upvoter and viewer we can make a some what irresponsible estimates of silent whales 19 4257 silent wsb kongs with 5187897 shares 190 42570 silent wsb kongs with 51878970 shares either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding tdlr just 473 wsb kongs hold 576433 shares worth 927m

76,52,2021-04-15 10:01:38,additional explanations to my gme counter dd why 192 shares held by institutions published by finra is wrong for those who have not read my gme counter dd why 192 shares held by institutions published by finra is wrong link so i would like to start by saying that this thread was born as a reply to a user but since it has become quite long and i think that some users might like to read it i thought to post it directly the discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links respectively black rock fund advisor black rock inc x200b i answered pragmatically indicating 2 links of response i know i was wrong to paste only 2 links without explaining why but i thought that those who understood my post would understand immediately black rock fund advisors x200b black rock inc x200b well now lets read the comment that disputes my thread x200b 1 you directly linked to a position of brfa ownership in gme and now it is useless come on dude do better the reason i pasted the 2 links as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3312021 from black rock fund advisors there are no updates since 2017 x200b 2 that 13fhr is the most recent holdings report can you show me where brfa sold this is where it gets interesting you can see that just after that date of the most recent 13fhr filed 20170210 black rock fund advisors has not submitted any more 13fhr forms to note their positions you can check it out for yourself in lieu of submitting the 13fhr black rock fund advisor has begun submitting a 13fnt form whats different just open the form to find out x200b you can tell right away what is written there 13f notice check here if no holdings reported are in this report and all holdings are reported by other reporting managers and list of other managers reporting for this manager if there are no entries in this list omit this section form 13f file number name 02812019 blackrock inc x200b look who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries but it is black rock inc with this 13f nt black rock fund advisor is basically saying from today on my daddy black rock inc will take charge of everything i have from here on black rock fund advisor presented only 13fnt form and bought only 45 stocks to date but lets see what was happening to black rock inc in the meantime these are the positions of blackrock inc on 20170210 taken from 13fhr x200b source what do you notice black rock inc had very few gme shares x200b but lets analyze the next 13fhr submitted by black rock inc on 20170512 x200b soruce but its magic black rock inc owns as many as 14 positions but how is that possible oh my god burn the witch but lets analyze the front page of this form 13fhr from 20170512 source x200b x200b lets analyze the most important passages 13f combination report check here if a portion of the holdings for this reporting manager are reported in this report and a portion are reported by other reporting managers and provide a numbered list of the names and form 13f file numbers of all institutional investment managers with respect to which this report is filed other than the manager filing this report if there are no entries in this list state none and omit the column headings and list entries look who is on the list but it is indeed black rock fund advisor x200b with that i have shown you how from 20170512 onwards black rock inc has taken over the position of all their subsidiaries the evolutions of those gme positions over time you can check for yourself also check out opening black rock incs position on the bloomberg terminal what comes up x200b x200b lets come to the other point made by the user also in your fidelity sale filing pay attention to section 7 they moved the securities to another company item 7 identification and classification of the subsidiary which acquired the security being reported on by the parent holding company see attached exhibit a here he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the fidelity gme sale posted on the gme forum i have already replied to this kind of comment and i paste one of my answers ive already been shown the thread you mean you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k the author of the post is simply wrong because x200b 1 there is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares 2 but lets say for sure that the author is right where is the new sec filing why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from january 29 onwards x200b 3 if there had been a real transfer there would be sec filings with different c i ks 4 for those who want to believe the fairy tale of the transfer of ownership through item 7 i just say go check out the other 13gs example i took 2 at random they all have the fucking wording item 7 identification and classification of the subsidiary which acquired the security being reported on by the parent holding company and exhibit a pursuant to the instructions in item 7 of schedule 13g the following table lists the identity and item 3 classification if applicable of each relevant entity that beneficially owns shares of the security class being reported on this schedule 13g opening every 13g there is this wording following the reasoning fidelity likes to pass shares in every fucking 13g xd x200b i would like to add that after reading what i have written here it should be clearer why fidelity has sold and not moved shares x200b i want to conclude by saying that after posting my gme counter dd i received many positive comments that understood what i was talking about but also many others that did not understand its okay to not understand some things i didnt understand them when i started either but i get annoyed by those who try to counter what i have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject this is why i sometimes respond badly x200b x200b edit since so many people ask for it here is a tldr tldr fidelity does not own any gme stock all the positions you see on the finra site ie fidelity management research company llc fmr inc and fidelity management and research company are an error fidelity sold in january instead the position of black rock inc which owns 9217335 is confirmed the other black rock fund advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong x200b tldrs tldr the finra data are completely wrong and are not to be taken into account

118,79,2021-04-27 15:02:07,what you really need to know about how short squeezes work and a screener to help must read so i think everyone on this sub now just goes this stock is about to short squeeze cause the short interest is high and people that are shorting will get margin called and just spewing shit most of the time cause they dont know the other two most important factors that go into it i came across a website finally that gave me the data that i have been looking for with out signing up for some shit and paying a fee iborrowdesk is seriously dope and gives the two other indicators to spot a short squeeze in the future the two other idicators for a short squeeze is of course a high short interest which this site doesnt give you but can find this info almost on anything now but the two other factors this gives you is the amount of available shares to short and the most important factor is the borrow rate you put these three things together you got a ticking time bomb to make a short squeeze work you need a decent high short interest of 20 a borrow rate of 20 and a low number of available shares to short left this is why we see some meme stocks fly and other go up 2$ good meme gme mvis tilray rocket bad meme clov and aso x200b if you go to iborrowdesk you can search tickers and see if the borrow rate is increasing over time and if shares available are staying the same or going down and using another website just look up high short interest stocks and put them in x200b so just an easy example for an explanation ticket abc has a short interest of 35 borrow rate has gone up from 230 over the last 3 months the available short is low which means not a lot of shares left to borrow abc has been trading sideways or increasing in price for 34 months $10 to $12 this means the shorts are losing 20 just on the stock price itself and if they hold for a year they will lose another 30 because of the borrow rate so they would need this stock to go below $7 to make money back which is ridiculous to hold for that amount of time and if borrow rate keeps increasing they will need to get out sooner than later so tickers i found mvis is def following this pattern to a tee one that is going to explode if this sub starts to trend it is triterras short interest above 30 borrow rate steadily increasing and is around 4550 available shares about 30000 stock trading sideways and slightly increasing for 4 months shorts would need this to drop to around 5$ in the next few months to make money back and if borrow rate keep increasing it will be impossible to make money and will have to sell let me know if any other tickers we could find some gems in this if people start doing this
26,7,2021-04-27 11:28:50,to vote on fidelity accounts trade statements proxy materials vote this should be the direct link you need your gme shares to be on in cash and not on margin if its on margin you need to call then and they can move it for you 18003433548 it was a 13min call for me if you have a margin account its likely you could be on an option level above 2 you must be 2 or below to be on cash or you cannot vote if you need to be on level 4 that allows you to do naked callput options you need to create 2nd trading account for fidelity with level 2 so annoying can someone share a link for that too and ill update
4962,449,2021-04-27 06:11:34,$gme technical analysis waves go brrr hi fam its me fam there is something going on with gme and it may be imminent this is my interpretation of gme thru wave countingelliotwave refer to this image first from a yearly point of view we have accomplished wave 1a and wave 2b colored blue for those colored blind idk how that works we are in the mist of forming wave c that will be interpreted in the following paragraph from this standpoint we have strong support level at 236 fib level priced 14279 it was actually broken but that level was a test to see how far it will go down it found support again twice on several different locations weeks later this is very important because the psychology of the market investors show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement even though we were consolidating now per elliot wave analysis wave 3 is the biggest wave of the 5 wave formation it must past the high of 48851 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or c wave there are several mini resistance levels we must past but as i am typing we pushed past two of them the next important level of all is price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 382 thats a magic number for later we can predict where wave 3 may end and that number is 504 34 53172 math not included refer to image this image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung the pendant is forming or has already formed its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market retail investors and all that there is a upward movement however there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out this image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 c wave 1 of wave c has completed and assumingly so wave 2 b of bigger wave 3 is consolidating pendant quick fib analysis we find resistance at fib level 236 priced at 16926 then again we have fib level 382 hovering around price 200 remember this important later down the road if we want some kind of breakout we need to close above 200 followed by some stimulus upward movement factor in addition this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs consolidation on the daily if we close above 169170 thats a great start then close above 200 price movement is building momentum for wave c which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves theoretically it needs to close above 35190 to confirm wave 3c but remember thats only the smaller version of wave 3 if this happens it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 depends on market volatility and demand to xxxxs tldr wave 3s forming there is a pressure on gme market and it may be bullish movement from now on consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels im not a financially literate to be a financial advisor but just shooting blanks i think my mom told me i lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during meiosis not mitosis per sfwsosa93 phase edit look at it go its literally erection time 40 mins past close

1514,234,2021-04-27 02:08:36,dd gme implied volatility update trend is lower for transparency here is my original post this post is just to share what i have been tracking since i first started trading options in gme every week or so ive been keeping track of option prices at different strikes when gme first lifted off to the moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week when it was at $325 around the end of january the 1 week move was plus or minus 40 that means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130 as you can see in this chart the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon the expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller x200b call option data source i personally gather it on those dates through etrade what do we do with this information if you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that its not going to drop to $50 overnight as cnbc would have you believe they parade idiots on their shows as analysts aka experts keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value same for most people you could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 $100 range as they are cheap right now also keep in mind as i stated in my previous post that the cheaper options bc the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options gamma pressure easier to manifest if the stock ever does drop below $100 i imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity everyone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by ryan cohen the first sign of that may be on the june earnings call i wont update this every week but when i see a change in trend or a big move in iv maybe ill post again good luck im not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice blah blah

198,133,2021-04-26 05:14:47,viacom cbs dd so bear with me cuz this is the first time i have ever pulled back the curtain from lurking to actually step up with my own contribution to the community so lets just get right to it my fellow crayon munchers we all know about the archegos fund meltdown and what it did to big ticket holding like disca and viac now obviously after seeing drops like they went thru no one wants to touch these stocks with a 10 foot pole until now these stocks massive sell off has created a huge opportunity for another bull run on viacom since it is now undervalued by about $15 or about 25 increase in the stock price as it currently sits conservative fair value estimates put the price target for viac at around $55 while some of the more bullish analysts price targets i have seen are sitting at $69 which would give it an upside of 420 coincidence i think not anyways all things aside the sell off has basically put a top performing stock on firesale with a huge upside that wall st has just started to see in the past couple weeks as it was up 824 this past week while i know alot of you apes see gains under 10 and are like so what who the fuck cares if its not 70 intraday gains like gamestonk or mvis to which i say fair enough keep sewering your money on weekly fds if you please i am still long gme with shares dont crucify me for looking for other opportunities as well however if there are any apes out there who are looking for some longer term safe plays with decent returns look no further viacom is a massive media conglomerate with rock solid financials stellar management team and solid business model their shift to streaming orientation is going to really boost their growth and kickstart what i believe will be the comeback of the year forsure position 1000 shares at $3840 lets go to the moon boys you saw what archegos did to the stonk lets show em why the planet of the apes is just as powerful tldr viac is on fucking firesale right now because of archegos sell off and wall st is just now seeing the opportunity for a comeback this is a hugely profitable company that is a healthy safe bet which is set to head back towards its previous levels in the next year so expect upwards of 20 growth by mid year edit for those real thrill seeking autists i also have 3 4450 calls for may 21st not just shares edited formatting to make eyes less likely to bleed
104,106,2021-04-25 11:57:23,$mp is about to soar dd mp materials is about to pop off and to my gme followers still holding on strong there two stocks is diversification right well mp sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the calinevada border they sit just south of las vegas right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore well lets start with what they do rare earth materials mining not the sexiest job on the planet but it is necessary for all things tech rare earths are a key component of clean energy it defense industrial applications and neat little magnets china was by far the 1 producer with 83 of the total worldwide production but now with mp materials pumping out ore they have fallen to only 58 of total worldwide production the market isnt going away but china could pull its supply which is a huge risk to the us tech industry on top of this demand will be skyrocketing with a projected increase in electric car production from 25m per year now to 31m per year in 2030 more specifically the annual demand for rare earth magnet oxides are expected to increase 5x in the next 10 years to $16bln and if that isnt enough potential revenue then also consider next year mp will have finished their own on site processing facility to produced finished metals instead of ore also worth considering china is only the leader because their population bears the cost of production that will likely see boycotts or backlash as new facilities are available and mp has created a sustainable process for extraction so likely the top brands will start pushing for more sustainable processes with less negative impact and potentially force china to clean up their act increase cost the uschina relations are at a pretty fragile point nasa has even called taiwan a country which is a hugely sensitive issue the current administration seeks to counter chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been reviewing the reliance on china for rare earths the price of rare earths is rising and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further though the stock price jumped it did plummet on news that they were issuing some additional shares about 10 to fund new green energy initiatives with a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects it makes $mp a prime target for ecoconscious investors in my opinion the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below its fair value 10 dilution rocked it to a 30 price dive that it is coming back from strongly now its also worth noting the share offering was at $35 which is $5 more than the current price meaning the serious buyers know the value of the stock is well above its current value $mp doubled the analyst estimates for eps in q4 last year and dont look to be slowing down looking ahead the forward looking eps estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 pe ratio with $038 eps in 2021 and theyve only been operating for four years 2022 eps is expected to jump more than 50 to $058 and that is before their processing plant is even open its not too hard to see that growth continuing with the addition of selling finished materials increased demand and increased price of the rare earth products which is on pace to continue for the next 10 years mp materials hasnt been around long taking over the site from failed molycorp but appear to be hitting it at a good time now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths if you look at their earnings presentation the story keeps getting better though they had 100 yoy revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production modest for q4 yoy but 25 for the entire year so thats the basics of mp but why the hell should you buy now well lets look at the current short borrow utilization that big drop it wasnt people selling it was an 18m share short attack now the short utilization is up to a whopping 93 and climbing note i prefer ff on loan for ortex because it tracks the si much closer than their estimated si so now the price is climbing again they are almost out of shorts to borrow and shit out of luck as they cover over the next month or two we can expect the price to rise easily back up to $45 especially with the q1 earnings call around the corner and when they beat earnings its gonna fly on top of that the growth stocks have all been on a severe downtrend over the last month but are popping back into fashion now with the huge si low share availability with only 130m shares and momentum of growth stocks in vogue today shits gonna sail edit i did some digging and estimated the q1 eps based on actual reo prices from q4 2020 to q1 2021 and came up with $027 eps or more than 3x analyst estimates a further very conservative estimate for the year puts it just under $1 eps way above analyst estimates as well when the q1 earnings come out this shits gonna go ree im not a financial advisor cat nor jedi this isnt financial advice a hairball or lightsaber

20,12,2021-05-07 08:33:38,webull to fidelity transferplease read if you are on webull and considering transferring please read if you are on webull and considering transferring i finally transferred my gme shares in webull into fidelitybut i thought id make this post to shed some light on the partial transfer vs full transfer ive have to do both since my partial transfer never went through partial transfer this will require a settled cash balance of $75 in your webull account prior to the transfer being completed my partial transfer request was never completed and just on hold with no updates to the status on fidelitys transfer tracker since 0424 until i called fidelity to find out that webull had rejected the transfercouldnt get webull on the line to ask them why however i decided to just initiate a full transfer after my friend was able to successfully transfer his shares over read on full transfer followed my friends advice who did a full transfer of his account into fidelity and im glad i did this i initiated the full transfer on 0430 and was completed yesterday so it will take about 34 days for a full transfer much quicker than the 12 weeks that they give as the amount of time they allow to process my estimated date of completion was 0513 but it completed yesterday 0505 and shares were available in my fidelity account when i checked this morning 0506 in initiating a full transfer it seems fidelity actually paid that $75 transfer fee because there was a $75 cash debit balance that was transferred into my fidelity account along with my gme shares and now i just had to deposit $75 into my fidelity account which theyre much quicker about to maintain my account balance without any negative cash debits this route was far easier than having to go about the deposit $75 into webull wait for it to clear and then settle then partial transfer and wait for the partial transfer to complete i think this is a good option for those who do not already have a $75 settled cash balance in their webull accountslike me i didnt have $75 in settled cash and to ach deposit wait for it to clear and then wait for it to settle in my webull account would take about 710 daysplus the time it takes to complete the partial transfer from webull into fidelityi suggest instead of going through that hassle to initiate a full transfer as it will only take about 34 days took my friend 3 took me 4 but this could have been due to me initiating the transfer on a friday evening however if you do have a $75 settled cash balance in your webull account then based on previous posts my suggestion would be to just initiate a partial transfer through fidelity as there would be no reason for the transfer request to be held up from webulls end this partial transfer based on previous posts seems to be completing in 2 days as opposed to the full transfers duration of 34 days just wanted to shed some light on this as i know there are many apes who are reluctant to transfer their shares into a broker with the assets to back up their positionsbut if youre hesitating from transferring from webull due to the $75 transfer fee etc then i think this post should help you in getting your gme shares over to fidelity asap based on your individual situation edit not financial advice what do i know

7,6,2021-05-07 01:22:51,an argument for transparency of positions as a tool for change in markets hello all this is not financial advise thank you to ugoldendust for the amazing work they have done i was able to make the following based on those 472 observations combined with my own 152 observations i have made a probability calculation of ownership just to give an illustration of what possible scenarios could be basically retail owns the float imo warning math incoming the calculations go as follows engagement on the stock is 10 million because wsb membership sets this bar i then estimate based on no data other than personal sentiment that around 35 of engaged people hold onto the stock so that gives us a maximum of 35 million active traders this will be the premise for the following the 624 total observations made by ugoldendust my own found average shares of people posting on yolo updates or positions in gme to be around 664 shares held thats a high number no dfv is not part of this data i removed his 200k shares is i think they disrupt the average too much so we are using it as the absolute maximum number of shares held in the most extreme scenario so the following table shows on the yaxis number of average shares in each scenario i have applied a 537 scaledown factor x200b on the x axis x200b x axis shows how many people of the total 35 million established maximum is holding in each scenario so for instance the most extreme scenario of shares held is 664 shares held by all 35 million people or 664 3500000 2324000000 shares held by retail investors the most extreme scenario of not held i 0 people engaged and 0 shares held so 0 now both these are very unlikely but they are used to built the following table so the table shows us what the amount of shares held in each scenario would be x200b all the red cells show scenarios of retail owning less than 46000000 shares which is the float all the yellow cells show scenarios where retail owns equal to or less than the float x2 all the green cells show scenarios where retail owns equal or more than float x3 then we examine how those scenarios come out in data x200b so basically there is a 59 probability in the calculation that retail owns more than float x2 i believe this is why transparency is important if one was to make a sec filing over concerns regarding market manipulation a accurate look into float ownership compared to reported si would be a good method for showing that there is something very wrong here i am not arguing for cooperation in terms of trading i am arguing that legitimate concerns should be raised and brought to the attention of the sec a report which accurately depicts ownership of more than 2x float would be irrefutable proof that somewhere in the system something is wrong i understand that this is unlikely to happen as it would require a trusted member of various communities i will now await downvotes and fud callers this was just me playing around with data i personally only hold 4 shares look forward to a hopefully civil debate
43,54,2021-05-06 11:02:57,aso technical breakout and dd good evening apes fellow smooth brains first off this is not some shill fud bs to distract you from our real fight only an opportunity to make some quick tendies tomorrow i am a long time lurker and gme holder 80 at $15418 but felt the need to share this idea to begin shares of aso traded 8 higher today after big 5 sporting goods corporation bgfv reported eps of 90 vs expected 50 yes almost double the expectation for q1 shares of bgfv had a 31 gain today based of this we can expect at minimum some sort of eps beat for aso when they report later this month looking at the chart for aso we see that it has been trading sideways and bullflagging nicely on the 180 day chart with the news of bgfvs earnings beat aso broke out of consolidation on high volume and closed today at $3329 just shy of ath at $3413 55 million shares were traded today compared to an avg daily volume of 184 million this is further confirmation of the breakout x200b aso from end of march 2021 to today aso chart from 319 to present day breakout because we are literally at aths anyone short the stock is or will soon be in the red and looking to cover that position before they become a gme style fuck up aso has 30 short interest feel free to confirm here or anywhere else on top of that in my smooth brained opinion aso is still far undervalued at this level even undervalued at $40 doing some simple pe comparison with dicks sporting goods dks and hibbett sports hibb we see that aso pe 92 dks pe 1502 hibb pe 1849 now im no good at math so ill leave the calculations up to you but a pe of maybe 12 still give us an upside of nearly 33 from currently levels or a share price of roughly $45 tomorrow i fully expect aso to at least test ath at $3418 and if we break above we could easily see a mini squeeze pushing the price higher potentially to $40 play throw this on your watchlist and set an alert at $3418 then buy shares or 35cs position tldr aso go up tmrw edit 1 thank you kind apes for my very first awards p edit 2 urobotlegs commented that aso released an 8k and s1 for earlier this week including preliminary sales up nearly 38 keep in mind this could change before official earnings but is an amazing piece of information here is the link edit 3 we are up 3 in premarket so far

24,20,2021-05-08 19:41:10,ex market maker ape calls it business not necessarily manipulation x200b jj gorilla keeps it real i just listened to two podcasts where the exmarket maker jj gorilla uvwaptrader1 tells it from the other side as retail traders we have to admit that we chase price but we should learn from our mistakes as quickly as possible one way to do that is to learn the mechanics and business of doing a deal in episode 187 jj goes on to say why he feels the $gme action wasnt all business and more needs to be considered to what is going on from those who hold the stock and how impressed he was with rwallstreetbets from what i took from the convo in essence he has a gut feeling that someone is using the hype to get out of gme and hes looking to the management what was even more interesting to me was the way he talks about supply and the order of events in which the business gets done as he explained that supply is the key to everything and how a market makers job is to facilitate those that need to sell their supply of stocksecuritiesassets etc and to provide liquidity to those traders looking to buy up to that supply x200b the gap and trap move he describes in the podcast played out to the letter yesterday in the nasdaq so i have no reason not to look more into what this exmarket maker has to say throughout the podcast there is talk of manipulation but of retail traders actions and emotions but if we understand their game we dont necessarily have to succumb to the pitfalls
35,37,2021-05-08 05:54:47,beware the index reconstitution process with hype stocks like gme you might think that most institutional fundsmutual funds wouldve gotten out and by this point it would be mostly owned by retail or investors that genuinely believe in gmes transition however that isnt the case as gme is heavily held by passively managed index funds vanguards small cap value fund vbr for example holds about $146 million worth of gamestop shares the same is true of most small cap value index funds index funds are reconstituted once a year for the russell indexes the finished index is communicated to market on june 25 last time the funds were reconstituted gme was absolutely a value stock trading at a great price to book value so it was included in the index when the index is reconstituted again given its massively increased price and price to book ratio it will almost certainly no longer be classified as value and thus dropped from value indexes this may lead to sell offs by funds that seek to track this index
1,29,2021-05-08 04:49:12,float short interest and what it all means i see a lot of bad assumptions made over the gme is 120 shorted statement float is a pool of available shares to short not the total number of shares of that stock these are typically owned by market makers and brokers or the company itself short interest is the amount of this float being borrowed by traders to short naked shorting that pushes si above 100 is simply borrowing shares not available to borrow because someone like me owns those shares so when a stock is shorted 120 of its float people did illegal naked shorting and borrowed shares not available to borrow shares privately owned nothing new got created a squeeze can happen when the price is driven up by enough people trying to find shares to cover their short that are not currently available to borrow as more people like you and me buy and hold actual shares or boomer shares as zoomers call them further decreasing the available floatcausing a low liquidity issue in the stock and their broker margin calls them so the price goes up until it hits what someone like me or maybe you will sell their share for buying options only will likely never trigger a squeeze also if a short trader gets upside down enough they can always declare bankruptcy and settle if they owe more than they are worth then nothing much happens to the stock price and mr bankruptcy isnt going to buy a single one his debts are clean depending the chapter declared i am not a cat
108,20,2021-05-07 19:01:58,very very low saleorders listed on premarket  hey fellow apes been following the this gme saga since end of january and today i really saw something that differs from the last week and months and made myself a proud xxholder please see below screenshot of the premarket bidasks x200b untill today i never recognised such low volumes of sales on the ask side in premarket current time in 954 central european time anyone else sees that and thinks it might be the first signs of the recent rule changes if not please dont hesitate and shed some light into this matter
37,31,2021-05-20 02:55:56,why shortsinstitutionsmms will always win clov analysis on 5142021 boa started to short clov and on 5172021 they downgraded the stock how absurd is this how do we even allow it this is just one of the institutions that does this and image how much they pay for all these bad reports against companies now clov is under investigation based on short reportsbut when will they start investigating these manipulations rich will always get richer huh look at boa downgrade after shorting clov x200b x200b now lets look at fintel and see which institutions are shorting $clov x200b boa is there huh citadel too wow what a coincidence what a surprise after hindenburgs report x200b now lets look at hindenburg who are always going after any company looking to short they have thousands of followers who will jump the ship and short it as well its funny how when gme took the squeeze they called it market manipulation and came after us our ceo had to go on lives with news reporters senate and all else but when they do this it is not manipulation its part of the broken and corrupt system anyways if you listened to the clov earning call and this fraudulent report you will see that they twist words just to manipulate the market and guess what the sec will never do anything x200b hindenburg and they citadel ties x200b anyways unfortunately we will not get the squeeze we were expected for this week but we should still be bullish in clov even after all this manipulation may 21 calls had high volume but mms want to make their money and they will never allow for a run the little guysretail investors can never win hopefully one day this changes
102,42,2021-05-10 13:20:49,in essence the stock market represents three separate categories of business take this quote by the original gme og to heart in essence the stock market represents three separate categories of business they are adjusted for inflation those with shrinking intrinsic value those with approximately stable intrinsic value and those with steadily growing intrinsic value the preference always would be to buy a longterm franchise at a substantial discount from growing intrinsic value his fundamental tenets are 1 margin of safety is king 2 look at evebitda 3 free cash flow 4 is it a well established franchise if those hit the mark do your own damn research to know what those should be do a deep dive into the company and management because at the heart of his value investing is this you dont look just for value you look for growth is it at a discount from growing intrinsic value that currently the market just isnt seeing now if you look across this entire market at the moment there is only one stock that hits all of this viacomcbs viac do your dd see if it hits those basic metrics then do the deep dive for instance take a look at the most recent q1 er call i really dont have much else to say this for those who know how to look for it is the current alpha in this market its a sleeping giant just do an even basic deep dive or dont really dont care this post probably wont even make it to being posted
268,84,2021-05-10 12:15:43,$nok deedee get your diamond hands off me you damn dirty ape$ hey mouthbreathers listen up if you sold nokia during the runup then you just hate money nok got caught up in the gme saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who dont understand how a short squeeze works and how gme went parabolic in one week lets keep in mind there were some good and truthful dd posts on nok in decemberjanuary and some great fucking dd on nok in the last couple months i suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts trying to find an affordable seat on the rocketship no nokia doesnt have a ton of short interest but i still really like the stock and id like to tell you why and a little bit about our future re john titor lets not forget about when this wasnt all about fucking the shorts jeezus christ nok is different from that bullshit because it truly has deep fucking value and believe me this goes deep they dont manufacture or sell phones anymore the only connection they have in making and selling phones is the nokia brand name being licensed out to a taiwanese manufacturing company called hdm global almost all the companys revenue comes from wireless network infrastructure and internet routing equipment lets go back and track this evolution in 2010 this only generated 30 of its revenue networking products cellular base stations etc in 2020 this made them 85 of their revenue nokia transformed itself into wireless technology company you fucking retards they did this through a series of autistic acquisitions aa in april of 2011 they acquired the wireless network infrastructure assets of motorola solutions this basically gave nokia all of motorolas 2g 3g 4g assets in august of 2013 nokia acquired nokiasiemens network joint venture and renamed the division nokia networks and that same year nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to microsoft the in early 2016 nokia agreed to acquire alcatellucent for $156 billion which gave then all of their wireless technology routers switches and optical tech within alcatel as well as bell labs formerly an alcatellucent division this final deal gave nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like ericsson and huawei head to fucking head yeah this is real you idiots and we know that huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo so where am i going with this and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future reefshark ai driven 5g wireless networks network slicing and the power of the future take an extra retard pill for the rest of this dd post youre gonna need it they have been building themselves up to this moment reefshark is the key here 5g network is the door and ai driven 5g network slicing is the living room of the future nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5g will be available it will ease the load of 5g network rollout because it has a 5060 reduction in energy use which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5g bandwidth it is the most efficient chip of its kind by far with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance this efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5g network they will go through mvno mobile virtual network operator to basically rent out their 5g bandwidth from a cloud this is called network slicing for all u chimps out there for example tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5g bandwidth more than 1000 companies use mvno already and most apes have not even heard of it yet here is how nokia fits into all of this techy garbage nok is already the biggest player in this market space they made up $45 billion of the $669 billion of telecom software and services in 2019 and reefshark makes them the unchallenged leader in this evergrowing market with ai powered network capabilities bonus level last year nasa selected nokias bell labs division to supply the 4g lte communications network for the moon soon no joke the actual moon not emoji moon before the end of 2022 they will put a highly functioning 4g network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the moon drop the crayons for a second and think about this ok now eat the red one its the same colors as your wifes butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4g talk is about with all the 5g shit rolling out nationwide changing the course of history answer the lunar surface is relatively flat so there wont be interference with the cheaper more practical 4g network we are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu the signal will travel further it just makes more sense they must start somewhere though this will evolve into 5g up there eventually nasa couldve given this contract to anyone but they chose nokia because they believe in them they believe nokia has the best performing wireless network equipment so i like the fucking stock ok insert rocket emojis fire boom flags all that shit right here the time to buy in is now

90,63,2021-05-15 08:13:02,$viac a hunch and a volcano waiting to explode intro there have been many posts recently about viac and for good reason the stock is chronically undervalued there have already been some posts that have gone very in depth about the fundamentals of viac that i read after i had a position in the stock but are nonetheless very enlightening in fact some of these reports are some of the first good posts i have seen on wallstreetbets since the gme craze has dragged out months too long but i digress summary if you dont know viac has already gone supernova just not in the way you might like essentially due to some wall street shenanigans with margin trading in amounts that would make even the most brazen in the wsb crowd blush the stock shot through the roof for some time some institutions hedge funds found about this and decided to sell realizing that if viac ever crashed it would crash hard and boy did it losing more than half its value in just a fews days viac was essentially nuked to shreds but the company continues to grow and recent earning reports have been good yet the stock has not been able to push past the $40 dollar mark this is where my theory comes in why i made this post and a simple theory we could hypothesize all day about why viac isnt budging from its current price point perhaps institutions arent willing to touch viac yet because the downfall left a bad taste in their mouth the lambs blood is on the door so to speak perhaps the valuation right now is fair and the wisdom of the masses is outsmarting me and you if you read the dds this does not seem to be the case but lets play devils advocate for a minute it could be a bevy of other things that are too technical for us retail traders to understand even though i believe these complexities are hardly ever the reason markets move but i have a simpler theory there are some whales who are offloading their shares around the $40 range and once we pass this mark this thing is going to go gangbusters i dont draw on charts very often so sorry if this is sloppy if you look at the charts viac just keeps bouncing around that $40 range and that resistance is most likely caused by whales who didnt sell fast enough to cut their losses these whales have hit this resistance multiple times and the dam is weakening there seems to be no viable explanation other than this as to why viac has not gained at least a marginal amount it simply defies logic i made this post not to convince you that viac is undervalued or anything like that if you cant see that you should stop trading now because this is as blatant as it gets i made this post to tell you to get on board while you still can the resistance is not going to last much longer come make some money with me positions $38 calls 91721
462,107,2021-05-15 04:26:45,using data visualizations to identify suspicious behavior on wsb note you can find interactive versions of visualizations for tickers here if youd like to look deeper into the data i just did a brief analysis here of the most obvious conclusions as some of you know ive been working with data on wallstreetbets discussion for well over a year now and i wanted to share a visualization i made the combines a few different metrics the goal was to visualize differences between the holders of different stocks and to try to identify instances of users attempting to manipulate discussion in a bad faith manner in order to do this i went through ticker by ticker and looked at all accounts who had mentioned the ticker in the last 3 years i then went through those accounts and looked at a few different metrics the first thing i looked at was how many days it had been since they had first commented on wsb i also looked at what proportion of their comments on wsb contained references to the ticker in question lastly i calculated the sentiment of their comments mentioning the ticker a visualization of all of those metrics looks something like this gme audience graph this makes it quite easy to compare the holders of different stocks for example we can compare the above visualization for gme with the visualization below for amd this provides the immediate and obvious conclusion that fewer newcomers to wsb have been discussing lisa su as evidenced by the more rightward leaning distribution of points along the xaxis amd audience graph but it also allows you to identify attempts at manipulating discussion for example this large dark dot in the upper left of the gme graph looks rather sus on a quick hover we can see that one user has been talking about gme an awful lot and doesnt seem to have had very nice things to say sus looking at their profile the math seems to check out their profile its worth noting that this post isnt meant to insinuate that theres a ton of people out there exhibiting this type of behavior on the contrary accounts like the one shown above were quite rare and if there are people participating in the discussion threads in bad faith its in a less blatantly spammy fashion if theres interest i will make an anonymized version of these visualizations publicly available
0,44,2021-05-14 20:27:03,all you guys talk about is gmeamc while ignoring the brewing short squeeze in $lmnd currently gt30 si stock could be set up for a major bounce due to being heavily oversold down some 6070 since highs in jan citron research andrew left came up with a lame short report yesterday after shorting it down 20 the prior day only for it to blow up in his face amp the stock running 7 yesterday leaving them miserably unable to cover the short citron research desperately followed up with 2 more tweets intraday but management immediately clapped back directly on twitter and the stock rallied further its interesting to note that 6x the daily average volume was traded on wednesday where it fell 20 despite an excellent earnings print this could possibly be multiple hedge funds collabing behind this short andrew left said his firm will stop activist short selling after the gme blow up only to go back on his words a few months later whats worse hes shorting a charitable public benefit corp in lemonade inc this is a $35b mkt cap stock with $12b in cash and no debt being shorted as if theyre headed for eminent bankruptcy a 89 yoy growth beast is literally being traded at close to its book valueshare thats insane tldr let the lemonade squeeze begin jan2023 $200c edit jesus i am shocked that all logic and arguments ive put forth are literally being ignored by many here in the comments just because my account was registered 2 months ago how shallow minded consider this post taken down i am no longer responding to your arbitrary comments that make zero reference to the content ive written this was supposed to be a fun dd but instead all ive gotten were insults not even funny type of insults just nasty insults thank you wsb for showing me how valued critical thinking is among this community clearly not a lot nothing personal i wish you all well just clearly not the place for intellectual discussions as i initially thought ill fuck off to somewhere other than here to discuss investing ideas u do you the memes yolos etc theyre great and i genuinely find them very entertaining but please dont fault peoplemainstream media for giving you a bad rep especially when this thread literally proves their talking points
4,14,2021-05-14 03:51:31,investing 101 for wsb fresh meat hello wsb you might recognize me as the author of that shitty gme dd that was taken down for hate violations rip old wsb that never came true actually i think there still may be truth to the post maybe hfs are hiding si maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon x200b x200b x200b but this post is not about gamestop i am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me how the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you dont know what writing a put means x200b x200b well i do know what writing a put means but i believe the newbies of wsb would like to hear my answer x200b x200b x200b how do you make money in the stock market if you arent a financial professional the answer is simple the longshort portfolio x200b x200b x200b what is longshort the premise of a longshort portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market even the best traders in the world cant guess and time every single economic event the goal of the longshort is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market the most basic longshort combination is spyvix if you compare the charts they are pretty much exact inverses of each other because of this you can protect yourself against a market crash x200b x200b x200b to give an example of how i use the spyvix i had spy investments that were up 25 around the 13th of april my belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon and when it does the rest of the market will sell off to act on this belief i pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the vix this reaction can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market gamestop was just an example if you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low and never purchase the spy at an all time high you will have a foolproof hedge not to mention the vix does not just pop on devastating market events normal corrections can be profited from through the vix as you can see this set up is made for protection for example if you were invested in the vix and sp before the covid crash your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased if you sold your vix and waited a year your spy would be back to its previous value and you would pocket the profit from the vix foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other a 5050 vix spy split will not be profitable x200b x200b there are many ways to set up a longshort portfolio spyvix is the simplest and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss and use that as a longshort its also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price and hedge with more mainstream investmentstools just like a certain dfv its ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a longshort backbone x200b x200b x200b all in all it is not possible to guess everything that will happen so how do good traders make money even if they dont understand the exact intricacies and implications of options or even economic functions in general longshort they dont know everything they just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything x200b x200b x200b x200b ok cool lots of talk about strategy but this is wsb and youre here for options so how do you use longshort with options invest the exact same way a boomer would but with leaps what is the difference between parking your spare cash in sp shares vs sp leap calls for 2 years if you are an active investor there is no difference in risk i would argue that through periodic vix investments it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares the benefit is that the return of the leap sp options will return much more profit then the shares x200b x200b x200b x200b disclaimer im not responsible for any money you lose and please if you dont know options research a lot before playing with them from personal experience it is very very easy to lose money if you want to practice the longshort use spyvixy shares for a safer start if you are new to investing in general paper trade first this is my own approach to the market i am sharing it because i got my start in the market through wsb this sub has cycles its normal for awhile then a post hits the front page and theres a huge influx of noobs eventually the words of the ogs get through to the noobs and they learn the game i think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the ogs can keep up with so heres my advice take it or leave it edit i am not a professional 
0,56,2021-05-12 12:59:11,gme dd since a few asked tldr slow deaths are so painful to witness looking at what is dominating price movements honestly nothing the options themselves are controlling the price how this is volatility mapped against time the characteristic pattern of vol decrease is characteristics of what i call consumer dead stocks ccl performed like this for awhile post2020 dipsies back when times were simplier and tendies frolicked freely anyways volatility is decreasing and its the dominant force in the stocks price whats that mean depends on where the options are oh look the only real position is 200000 puts at 1$ what do these options do when volatility decreases in an environment where volatility is the dominant force they cause hedgeselling this is made worse when you look at how the options deltas are changing with price decreases as well they are delta hedged also by selling so on both fronts decreasing volatility and decreasing price are causing selling both of which are occurring but not in a way that is significant for a downward squeeze but a slow menacing squeeze like the time you chaffed your wifes bf is there threat of an upsqueeze lol there are 187581 calls compared to 905192 puts people cant even sell calls it seems so i would say minimal tldr the tldr gme is sinking into the abyss being held up only by whoever keeps mouthtomouthing it with their wendys check x200b edit we see in the comments below who is holding bags lol gl amigos
1127,878,2021-06-01 13:34:06,housing 2007 again just curious about what the apes think about the housing market i work for a high end $1m general contractor and i think youd have to be brain dead to build or buy right now housing is through the roof because money is cheap but if you think there were tp and gas shortages try to buy land right now then check insulation prices then check lumber then check literally everything else youre 30 over the 10yr average for same home why are homes flying off the shelf when they shouldnt be talk to anyone you know in construction we are over balls deep in work and we cant sustain demand housing is in a state of emergency and when this bitch corrects itself itll reverberate like its 2008 gme iswas cool and all but us housing is about to remind the world what real movement looks like
314,474,2021-05-31 22:49:06,what is dtc and why you still shouldnt care i often see people in the daily thread leaving lazy comments about ticker x has short interest of y this is dumb and you should feed bad about wasting our time with something so useless x200b what is short interest here we find the first reason why this is dumb comment short interest is an incredibly vague concept usually you see it reckoned as a percentage of the float or the shares outstanding but even this is not a consistent definition thinking back to the gme runup there were two numbers being thrown around for short interest 140 and 270 x200b the first number 140 was short interest divided by the total shares outstanding if a company has 1000 shares outstanding and 200 shares have been short sold this works out to a 20 short ratio but not every outstanding share is available to trade on any given day many will be owned by the company itself insiders and institutions that are not legally allowed to sell them without doing a bunch of publicly available priced in paperwork so sometimes youll see numbers like the second 270 which use the shares that are available to trade on any given day as the denominator if only 700 shares are available to the market that will increase the short float to almost 30 x200b trouble is how do you define a share that is available to trade if you dont know the definition that was used when calculating the number youre throwing around then you dont know what the short float number actually means and if you dont know or cant explain it then you shouldnt be wasting our time with it because its meaningless x200b what is days to cover there is another way of reckoning short interest that actually does have some validity days to cover is a measure of how many days of trading it would take for every short position to be unwound this is the total number of shares shorted divided by the average trading volume that ratio is the number of days on average it would take for shorts to cover if every short position had to be closed as quickly as possible it would take that many days if every share traded were used to close a short position for short interest by any metric to reach zero this is at least a little bit useful because you can tell how long an increase in buying pressure from short positions being closed is likely to last x200b why even dtc is not particularly useful x200b even dtc can be an inconsistent metric though as likely not every short position must be closed immediately reducing dtc and the fact that it is taking the average volume means that a single high volume day could easily drop that number substantially you dont know whats going to happen just because you have access to a single metric which is also available to every other trader on the market and that includes those with open shorts going back to the gme example even at the height of the short squeeze craze dtc was sitting at just over six days six days of average volume to cover and we saw trade volumes that were an order of magnitude higher than that average does that mean the shorts covered who knows you certainly dont even if someone on the internet told you they didnt x200b its probably not a short squeeze while the concept of a short squeeze is valid you need to understand that they are incredibly rare events if you want to make trading them your primary strategy have fun but be ready to wait a long time years for the next opportunity you dont know when short positions need to be unwound and theres no way for you to force anyone to do it involuntarily you can be sure that they are doing everything in their power to minimize their lossesmaximize their profits and you should do the same why should we believe that a ticker that is 30 short with a dtc 1 is going to squeeze if you cant explain that then its not worth crowing about nobody cares about your halfthought out conspiracy theory dfv spent a year building his case and still came within a few months of his positions expiring worthless michael burry almost went bankrupt waiting for the housing market to crash you dont hear the stories of the ones who lost it all even if they were right on the premise x200b if youve got knowledge of squeeze that is incoming great but build a case for it wildly screaming gme short interest 30 in the daily is not a case shouting gme dtc 14 days is a little more informative but ultimately meaningless without further context can they afford to spread the covering out over several days a week four fucking months how many are held by a single entity and therefore likely to be closed all at once what is the price doing why would they get squeezed if the position is profitable and looks to continue being profitable for the foreseeable future if you dont know then nobody is going to care x200b no bullshitting we have a rule here no bullshitting dont make shit up and be responsible giving and taking advice this includes talking about things you dont know about you should listen not talk nobody wants an illinformed opinion lurk more nobody wants an illinformed opinion nobody wants an illinformed opinion if youre in the daily thread vomiting numbers that are effectively meaningless in an attempt to puxfeffmp your pet stock expect to be at best ignored i know youre excited and this may be your first foray into the market welcome

60,26,2021-06-12 12:42:26,a beautiful partnership between gamestop and corsair gme crsr we should get this movement started and the idea out there gamestop has had talks of getting more into the pc gaming and streaming market who would be great for that corsair crsr this would be absolutely huge and i could see something like this potentially happening in the future as gamestop looks for new ways to innovate itself it would be awesome to see gamestop introduce more pc gaming into its lineup of products along with the streaming side of things in retail stores and its website currently corsair is one of the leading pc component gaming and streaming suppliers a partnership between these two to offer all of its product lineup would not only help both of their stock prices but would increase revenues and growth for both companies it almost seems like a no brainer and im surprised something like this has not happened yet i say we get this trending i am currently invested in both and probably will be yoloing a shitload more into crsr and gme this next week and going into the end of the month i also will tag ryan cohen gamestop and corsair across different platforms to see if they would respond and be open to the idea if enough people push the concept maybe they will listen after all alot of us are shareholders crsr currently sits undervalued and unoticed at 3276 a share has not even hit the lowest analyst price target has a very small float and the potential for a major surge as more investors and traders jump on board and buy up the float current market cap is 297b revenues are increasing substantially year over year and new products rolling off the line steadily this will catch up with logitech in no time in my opinion gme currently sitting at 23710 a share with a slightly larger but small float aswell possibly going into the russell 1000 will be a big catalyst add these two together and you have magic and a beautiful catalyst for both then the wallst junkie analyst can tune back their tone in saying whats gamestop going to do to expand and grow its revenue its overvalued anyone with me on this idea i think it would be great for both companies and would be awesome to see gamestop finally enter the pc and streaming world fully at all its locations and website it would be nice to have them as a one stop shop at brick and mortar for all the essentials

61,20,2021-06-12 04:16:25,last change gme gap fill incoming first let me start out by saying im an ape who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest rarest and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices wallstbets know that if they let gme drop from this spot here the entire meme frenzy will die this is 100 the next rip also i absolutely hate fundamentals but this isnt a play based on that but rather based on the momentum old heads dont see that and are still buying shares of the dow on their quotrons now lets look at the technicals heres where shit gets interesting price action first off we need to analyze the price action of gme and right off the bat we see a massive gap right at $305 short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326350 we will absolutely moonshot to $400 that is if however we transition from these irrelevant clov and bb stocks and roll over our gains into gme x200b also rsi starting to taper historically gme has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so im not surprised to see a dip right here the thing is however that gme absolutely crushed earnings the previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low fibs this spot right here is the single greatest fib retracement i have ever seen hovering right at 618 otherwise known as the golden trade the support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a t so we can expect a reversal is coming x200b option vol now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing you can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310 lets also look at the put volatility which has been linear this is due to the hedge funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop if my theory is correct more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when gme is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap x200b pc ratio put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out a $4000000 call in july thats big money and while these big institutions are shorting the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in you can see that there are a couple of multimillion dollar call spreads and naked calls the problem here is that your average tard doesnt have $3000 for a naked call so thats why cheaper contracts will fill the gap x200b if you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now this could be the biggest trade of the year wallstbets is an organization that i believe will not go down without a fight and i see them planning a massive rally with gme through their instagram and twitter pages what you apes dont understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything and the organizers of wallstbets are absolutely banking on the shit that is ripping a lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see buy gme cannot go tits up on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their robinhood account expiring next week at the end of the day do your own due diligence the stock is cheap right now and im definitely buying i believe in wallstbets and i think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution and that these events will be engraved in financial history this cannot go tits up not financial advice dont wanna get sued im gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at arbys is almost over
78,6,2021-06-12 03:08:24,the great gap fill play $ e b i x chart update for $15 upmove x200b since my last post the chart has been playing out perfectly and price is set for a quick move to fill the gap technical analysis update price has officially confirmed that the $3400 level turned from resistance into support with yesterdays june 10 daily candle wicking $3400 and rejecting it we can see buyers are stepping in to protect that level the red candle from yesterday june 10 closed with less volume than the uptrend candles the days prior which is supportive of our bullish thesis bullish continuation usually has increasing volume on bullish price with less volume on pullbacks todays candle is especially bullish as price has cleared above yesterdays and the day priors high again the float of this stock is extremely low so price can move even more volatile compared to gme unusual option activity we are seeing more unusual options coming in all with sweep orders sweep orders are the most bullish unusual options in where participants buy fractions of their entire order from different exchanges to hide their purchases from the public eye tldr this trade is now confirmed as extremely bullish and it is set for a quick move into $50 minimum

616,182,2021-06-10 20:28:21,wish do not forget before or after the rally its still underevaluated as always i never give financial advice and this is not different 10 days ago i did some dd about wish which came right at the bottom dd to my wife mods its my dd now my wife is very happy and she may consider breaking out with her boyfriend who was all in on c3ai the main goal of the dd was to present to you a great opportunity at least for me of a company that have a great potential and really undervaluation the goal is not to make it a meme stock but if we get both of them this can be great because fundamentally the company have great numbers x200b now why i think wish is preparing to go to moon 1 it had a short float average 9m day in the last 6 months but for the last 10 days its about 20m day and as we all know when the consolidation is done with a very a high volume its just the sound og the gas added to the rocket and now the breakout was done with 200m300m dayly volume which is a tremendous bullish sign 2 40 short interest ts very high for a company with good fundamentals at the bottom 3 until now the big boys were adding shares in the same time they were selling puts and i you know institution will only sell puts when it thinks the company will go up or its underevaluated so they will be more than happy if they got assigned 4 consider best buy in 2012 when everyone thought bankruptcy was inevitable and best buy stock had plunged from $40 to $10 today shares trade north of $100 consider nintendo in 2013 when everyone thought the gaming titan had lost its magic touch and the stock also dropped from $40 to $10 today nintendo stock trades above $60 or even etsy for which the ipo price was 16$ the first day of trading went to 35$ after that it went back to 6$ in 6 months well look at it now 167$ or consider twitter in 2016 crocs in 2017 chipotle in 2018 tesla in 2019 wayfair in 2020 finally this is maybe a dumpster diving that have a great 300 potential as a gme fun and past retard investor i know the facts and the facts saying that on wish we are at the bottom and the upside potential is there

3,26,2021-06-10 14:48:45,there was no overvote trimming etc im seeing a lot of misinformation claiming that there was an overvote with gme and the results were trimmed or normalized this is based on the incorrect basis that gme insiders cant vote so the total number of votes should be capped to the free float 54 million however gamestops schedule 14a that was filed earlier today makes it clear that this is not the case insiders are allowed to vote as well so the total vote cap is 70m since 55m votes were cast 78 it was no where near 100 and there is no reason to trim or normalize votes proof 2 who is entitled to vote holders of record of shares of common stock as of the close of business on april 15 2021 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting shares of common stock can be voted only if the stockholder is present or is represented by proxy at the annual meeting as of the record date 70771778 shares of common stock were issued outstanding and entitled to vote

91,25,2021-06-29 03:36:32,gme and goev charts look eerily similar the past 3 months if you overlap gme and goevs 6 month chart it looks like they follow the same pattern since the end of march goev blue gme orange before march the price action is completely unrelated the end of march was when canoo announced their change in business model during their first earnings call and the stock was heavily shorted after march their movements seem pretty similar canoos short interest has been inching upward the past 3 months now at almost 40 also the borrow fee is now up to 454 up from 27 last week x200b are these chart similarities only due to gme and goev both being heavily shorted stocks getting traded by the same algos or could it also have something to do with them being tradedshorted by the same hedge funds

114,184,2021-07-11 18:15:54,boring times ahead lots of extreme opinions out there on direction these days it has me thinking that the contrarian view is middleoftheroad not in one extreme or the other times are actually kinda boring and not much is happening really popular bear case think were topping the greatest speculative bubble in history a great depression is around the corner the buzzwords are debt crash or the money printing machine is out of control the typical argument here is that total debt is unsustainable in the current economy well if you take total us debt subtract the $6 trillion in gov debt and $5 trillion in fed debt youre left with $175 trillion in actual debt thats 80 of gdp not the 100 which gets tossed around the net interest expense to gdp is lower than it was in the 80s and even in the 80s it wasnt a problem linked below a secondary reason were not bubbling prices are not detached from reality as many would have you believe bubbles are a separation of fundamentals to price but consensus earnings on the sp500 are $200 compare that to $4300 on the sp500 thats a 47 yield or a 215 pe overvalued perhaps bubble territory far far from it also linked popular bull case think were entering the greatestspeculativebubbleofalltime the belief here is usually that lower rates plus stimulus are pushing asset prices to south sea company territory thank you sir isaac newton that the money printing is so outrageous and this new money will magically get shoved into assets like real estate or stocks ignoring the fact that excess liquidity is pulled out by the government proportionally the issue here is that lending restrictions are far tighter than they were leading up to 08 even if you could borrow like crazy institutional investors have their own leverage policies individuals are mostly conservative average joe doesnt refinance his home and buy gme or his wife would go find a boyfriend we are just recently seeing measures taken by wells fargo where all lines of credit are deactivated here in canada stress tests for mortgages are 3x of what the listed rate is overall this way of thinking is inline with great investors there is always something to worry about throughout history all you can do is look at the options available to you and act on the ones you like debt to gdp snp earnings
